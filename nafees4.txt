HOMEMADE INSTANT NOODLE MIX SERIES: INSTANT DANDAN NOODLE MIX

WHAT:  The untimely demise of your pre-summer diet.  An instant dandan noodle sauce that will create, for you, this iconic Sichuan street food, any time any day, in under one hello-cellulite! minute.

WHY:  Because I now have a huge jar dangerously in my possession, constantly tugging my soul in between responsibility and liberation, misery and happiness.  And they both want company.

HOW:  There are as many variations to dandan noodles as the number of people making it, each altering the ratio between sauce and noodle, the style and intensity of the seasonings, the types of noodles and toppings, all to their own particular likings.  I, for example, have published this dandan noodle recipe a long time ago, which was decidedly more soupy and negotiated its way towards the peanut-y route back when I gave more shit about my sesame intolerance (it’s like lactose intolerance but only more niche).  Now, this version, aside from the difference that it is meticulously designed as an all-in-one sauce mix, is actually more authentic to the flavors that I often found myself slobbering over when I was still living in China, more sesame-based, assembled together more as a sauce than a soup, filled with savory beef-bits that are freckled with ground Sichuan peppercorns, and it doesn’t call for doubanjiang (broad bean chili paste).

Well, authentic, up until the pickled jalapeño comes in.

Now, why American pickled jalapeño as opposed to Chinese pickled mustard greens as authenticity would’ve commanded?  Well, A)  I don’t care about authenticity.  And B)  Even in Asia, Chinese pickled mustard greens tend to vary greatly in quality, saltiness and taste, making it a very unfriendly ingredient in recipe-development.  Then last and certainly not least C)  I happen to decide that, in this particular instance, pickled jalapeño actually works more marvelously than its traditional counterpart, more acidic than salty, more ready-to-use, and more fragrant in terms of the much desired peppery-ness that beautifully integrates and aids the layering of flavors in this beloved Sichuan dish.  Each seasoning functions as an distinct entity, accurately marking their highs and lows, sharp and creamy, spicy and numbing on the tempo of their own choosing, but ultimately all comes together as a harmonic yet active, single organism.

Is this the best dandan noodle you’ll ever have?  I dare not say that myself.  But you just might.

INSTANT DANDAN NOODLE MIX
Ingredients
0.75 lb (320 grams) ground beef
1 tbsp fish sauce
2 tsp soy sauce
2 tsp toasted sesame oil
1 1/2 tsp ground Sichuan peppercorns
1 1/2 tsp cornstarch
1 tsp grated ginger
3 cloves of garlics, grated
1/2 tsp ground white pepper
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 packed cup finely mined pickled jalapeño
1 cup canola oil
3 scallions, smashed and cut into segments
4 cloves of garlics, smashed
5 tbsp Sichuan chili flakes
1/2 star anise
1 tbsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp curry powder
1 1/2 tbsp white sesame seeds
2 tbsp ground Sichuan peppercorns
1/2 cup + 2 tbsp medium white sesame paste/tahini (see note *)
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 1/2 tbsp smooth peanut butter
1 1/2 tbsp light brown sugar
1 tbsp chicken powder
1 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar
8 cloves of garlics, grated
Store-bought or homemade low sodium chicken stock
Finely minced pickled jalapeno
Finely diced scallions

Instructions
1. MAKE BEEF MIXTURE: In a large bowl, mix ground beef, fish sauce, soy sauce, toasted
sesame oil, ground Sichuan peppercorns, cornstarch, grated ginger, grated garlics and ground
white pepper until even, then set aside. In a NON-STICK skillet, heat canola oil over medium
heat. Cook the finely minced jalapeño until shriveled and almost crispy (partially cover the skillet
to prevent splattering), about 2 minutes. Drain it through a fine sieve, reserve the crispy
jalapeño, and return the oil back into the skillet. Add the ground beef-mixture, breaking it up into
small chunks with a wooden spoon, until they are evenly browned and caramelized. Add the
crispy jalapeño back in and turn off heat. Set aside.
2. MAKE CHILI OIL: In a small pot, cook canola oil, scallions and garlics over medium heat, until
the scallions are deeply browned on all edges. Remove the solids with a slotted spoon, drain
well, and discard. In a spice-grinder, process Sichuan chili flakes, star anise, ground coriander,
ground cumin and curry powder until thoroughly powderized. Transfer the spice-mixture into
/2020
2/2
the oil, along with white sesame seeds, and return the pot to medium heat. Continue to cook,
stirring constantly, until the color of the oil turns from a bright red color to a dark maroon
color, about 1~2 minutes. Turn off heat, and stir in the ground Sichuan peppercorns. The
residual heat will continue to cook the mixture. Set aside for 10 minutes.
3. FINAL MIXING: In a large bowl, add the ground beef-mixture, chili oil (do not drain), medium
white sesame paste, soy sauce, smooth peanut butter, light brown sugar, chicken powder,
balsamic vinegar and grated garlic. Mix with a large fork until evenly mixed. Transfer into an airtight container and keep refrigerated for up to 3 weeks (estimate). Can be divided into smaller
portions and stored in the freezer as well. Thaw to room-temperature and mix well before using.
4. TO SERVE: By volume, mix equal parts of instant dandan noodle mix with equal parts of low sodium chicken stock (warm the chicken stock if coming straight from the fridge) to create
the dandan noodle sauce. Be quite generous with the sauce:noodle ratio, making it almost
semi-soupy!! I like to use ramen noodles for this particular dish, but you can choose any
noodles that you prefer. Then garnish with finely minced scallions and more finely mined pickled
jalapeño.

Notes
* What I mean by "medium" sesame paste/tahini is sesame paste that is darker than the very pale
Middle Eastern tahini, but much lighter than the very dark Chinese-style sesame paste. Which means
I always go for Japanese-style white sesame paste (such as this one) that is perfectly in the middle.
And from the look of it, this Trader Joe's tahini looks about right as well.

Instant cheesy Japanese curry
udon/noodle mix
Ingredients
3 tbsp canola oil
1 large onion, peeled and roughly chopped
10 cloves of garlics, roughly chopped
3 tbsp onion powder
6 cups (1400 ml) low sodium beef or chicken broth
1 regular box (230~250 grams) Japanese curry cubes, such as this one (see note *)
5 slices of American cheese, torn into small pieces
1/3 cup (30 grams) grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
4 tbsp curry powder
2 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder
1 1/2 tbsp fish sauce
1 tbsp ground cayenne, plus or minus to your liking
2 1/2 tsp instant coffee
1 tsp Dijon mustard
Instructions
1. In a large, wide and deep skillet (the wide diameter creates more surface area and speeds up
the reduction process), cook canola oil, onion, garlics and onion powder over high heat, until the
edges of the onions are slightly browned. Add low sodium beef or chicken stock, continuing to
boil over high heat, until the mixture is reduced down by 2/3, about 20 minutes.
2. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into another smaller pot, pressing on the solids to extract
as much liquid as you can then discard the solids. You should have about 1 1/2 cup of liquid
left (it can be slightly under but not more). Now add the curry cubes, American cheese,
Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, curry powder, cocoa powder, fish sauce, cayenne, instant coffee
and Dijon mustard. Cook and stir over medium heat, until all the ingredients are fully melted and
evenly incorporated into a thick paste.
3. Transfer into an air-tight jar and keep chilled in the fridge until needed. Can be kept for up to 1.5
(estimate) months in the fridge, or 3 months in the freezer.
4. TO USE THE MIX: You can use the mix to make a lighter drinkable curry broth, or a stronger
gravy-like sauce. To make a curry broth, bring 1 cup of water to a simmer and whisk in 3~4 tbsp
of instant curry mix, and let simmer for a couple minutes. Add udon noodles or other noodles of
your choice. To make a gravy-like sauce, cook udon or other noodles of your choice in boiling
water according to instructions. Remove the noodles and set inside a serving bowl. Mix a few
tbsp of the cooking water with curry mix until it reaches your desired consistency and intensity,
then mix it evenly with the noodles. As a general finishing touch, torch a slice of American
cheese on top until melty, and serve immediately.
Notes
* Japanese curry cubes, or curry sauce mix, can be easily found in all major Asian supermarkets
and/or online. This recipe calls for one regular box, which ranges from 230~250 grams depending on
the brands (but they do come in smaller packaging sometimes so make sure you check the package).
And they also come in "mild", "medium", and "hot". Here I'm using "hot".

HOMEMADE INSTANT NOODLE MIX SERIES: INSTANT PHO BO MIX

WHAT:  Instant pho bo noodle soup mix, the answer to the prayers of all the geographically misplaced and physically unable foodies who make the regrettable mistake of watching a Vietnam street-food video on Youtube pass 10 PM.  We know who we are.

WHY:  Widely known as a labor-intensive and time-consuming dish, yet cruelly happens to be the most desired slurp from Southeast Asia in North America, pho bo has been tormenting addicts who are kept apart from a proper fix due to cold hard geography, or, something no less ruthless, a human condition called sloth.  But this barrier is no more, my friends.  Because what is mankind if not the extraordinary will to cheat its way through shortcomings?

HOW:  Every single aromatics and spices that are used in the traditional preparation of pho bo undergoes the exact same treatment in this recipe, the charring of the onion and ginger, the roasting of shrimp paste, the calculated balance of spices.  The only difference is that the mixture is blended together with an ultra-reduction of store-bought beef broth and fish sauce, into a smooth, saucy seasoning.  When the craving hits, the complete obliteration of the ingredients allows their full and speedy release of flavors and aroma where they dissipate into more beef broth (don’t worry, still store-bought), creating a marvelously close-tasting broth to the ones that take hours, all in just 2 minutes.  From this point on, all it needs is a mandatory fine-tuning of lemon juice, sliced onion and fresh herbs to bring it quintessentially Vietnamese.  Then, a couple squirts of Sriracha and hoisin sauce to make it non again.

Here you ask, is this the same as the pho bo you tasted in Saigon where you lost a tender piece of your soul behind and was left to wonder this earth forever incomplete?  Pffff, of course not!  A cheat is a cheat.  Anyone who’s tried liposuction will tell you they don’t look like Gisele Bündchen quite yet.  But I will say this, that in between all the sad Vietnamese restaurants provided by the cities where I’ve stayed in the past almost two decades – New York, Taipei, Hong Kong, Beijing – or the alternative of plowing through 12 hours of labor whenever the craving hits, honestly, I prefer this instant mix over any of the above.  And if you know me at all, that’s saying a lot.

INSTANT PHO BO MIX

Ingredients
4 cups (950 grams) store-bought premium low sodium beef broth (see note *)
1 medium onion, peeled and quartered
1" (20 grams) peeled ginger, sliced
1 tsp Lee Kum Kee shrimp paste
2 star anise
8 whole cloves
1/2 tsp black peppercorns
2 tsp ground fennel
2 tsp ground coriander
3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground white pepper
1 lemongrass, roughly cut
1/4 cup +2 tbsp (90 grams) fish sauce
1 1/2 tsp light brown sugar
2 tsp MSG, optional (see note **)
2 cups store-bought premium low sodium beef broth (see note *)
3 1/2 tbsp instant pho bo mix (see note ***)
Fish sauce to season
Rice vermicelli, blanched before using
Thinly sliced beef, beef balls, and any other topping of your choice to serve
Thinly sliced onions, scallion, bean sprouts, fresh mints, fresh Thai basil, lemon wedges to
serve
Sriracha and hoisin sauce to serve.

Instructions
1. In a wide and deep skillet, bring 4 cups of beef broth to a boil over high heat, and continue to
cook until it is reduced down to 1 cup, about 15 to 20 minutes. The reason why we want to use
a skillet instead of a pot is because the wide surface area will help the evaporation go much
faster.
2. Meanwhile, place a baking rack directly on top of the stove and turn the flame to high. Toast the
quartered onion and ginger until they are thoroughly charred on the surfaces and edges.
Remove the ginger first, then smear the shrimp paste on the surfaces of the onion, and toast
again for the paste is blistered and dry, about 30 seconds. Transfer all of it into a blender and
set aside.
3. In a small skillet, dry-toast star anise, whole cloves and peppercorns over medium-low heat,
until it starts to smoke and the peppercorns start to pop. Remove the skillet from the heat,
and add ground fennel, ground coriander, ground cinnamon and ground white pepper, and
return to the heat. Stirring diligently, and dry-toast just for a few seconds more until fragrant.
Transfer immediately into the same blender.
4. Add lemongrass, fish sauce, light brown sugar and MSG into the same blender. Then add the
reduced beef broth. Blend on high for 2 full minutes until smoothly pureed. Transfer into an airtight jar and keep in the fridge until needed. Can be kept for up to 1 month in the fridge. Mix
before using.
5. You can also divide the mix into ice-cube moulds then freeze them.
6. TO ASSEMBLE (for one serving): In a small pot, simmer beef broth and instant pho bo mix
together for 2 minutes, then strain the broth through a fine sieve (the finer the sieve the
cleaner the broth). Press on the solids to extract as much broth as you can, then discard the

INSTANT PHO BO MIX:
TO ASSEMBLE (for each serving):
1/17/2020
2/2
solids. Taste the broth and re-season with more fish sauce if needed. Now you cook
whatever toppings in this broth, let it be sliced beef, beef balls or etc. Pour the broth over the
rice vermicelli, then top of thinly sliced onion, scallions, mint and basils, then serve immediately
with a wedge of lime or lemon. Dip in Sriracha and hoisin sauce if desired.
Notes
* For low sodium beef broth, I'm using Imagine Organic Beef Broth, but you could also use 365
Everyday Value Organic Beef Broth or Pacific Foods Organic Beef Broth. The reason why I want to
use slightly more "premium" brands of broth is because it's such a crucial component in this recipe,
the quality of which will significantly affect the final result. So as a general rule of thumb, I will stay
away from brands like SWANSON, CAMPBELL'S, or any other broth that contains tomaotes.
** Every bowl of pho bo in Vietnam has MSG. It's practically regarded as a crucial ingredient. I'm not
going to argue with that.
*** The instant pho bo mix is what gives the final broth its aroma and spice intensity. This ratio
between beef broth and instant pho bo mix (2 cups of broth with 3 1/2 tbsp of the mix) is determined
according to my own taste, which provides quite a intense broth. But you can certainly adjust it based
on your own liking. If you like a lighter broth, add less mix, and re-season with more fish sauce to
make up for the saltiness.

HOMEMADE INSTANT NOODLE MIX SERIES: CRACK SLURP MIX

homemade instant noodle, will no longer be an oxymoron
Today we’re launching yet another recipe series!  One that I’ve been wanting to put together for awhile and, if I’m being totally honest, I haven’t been this excited about something for a long time.

It’s called, Homemade Instant Noodle Mix Series!

This new series is my answer to my own struggle over the years during the frequent occurrences when instant noodles – one of my loyal and trusty, lifelong companion – fails to be A) adequately satisfying, B) available at wherever I am currently residing, C) excessively reliant on chemical flavorings and preservatives, and D) reaching the full potential of the culinary wonderland that instant noodles have every capability to become.

This series will bring you relatively easy recipes that each creates one large batch of an ultra-concentrated seasoning, very much like the flavoring packets that come with commercially packaged instant noodles except in a larger quantity, which you could later use to build better-than-most-commercially-sold instant noodles simply by adding water, stock, and noodles of your choice.  Less than 20 minutes of cooking will secure you with a great number of highly gratified, 5-minutes slurps for months to come.  Just the mere idea of having contributed a few of these into this rotten, twisted, putrid world of our own making, makes me feel like I’ve done my part as a repenting member of the society and thus releases me from a few years of intensive therapies.

Because from this day on, homemade instant noodle will no longer be an oxymoron.  From this day on, whenever we crave either the convenience or deliciousness of an instant slurp, we shall be free from concerns of being mummified by excessive preservatives or growing a fifth limb from the unpronounceable ingredients in fine prints.  From this glorious day on, we the people, shall not be denied of our rights to all the possibilities of instant noodling based on our nationality, wealth, travel visas, broken supermarket inventories, the tyranny of international trading policies and above all, the utter lack of creativity from every major instant noodle manufacturers.  Hear me, Zeus!…

Okay that’s a bit much but you get the point.  This series will touch upon new slurpable delights inspired by Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asian and etc, but to kickstart it:

WHAT:  A Lady And Pups classic from the archive called Crack Slurp, now reincarnated in a single, streamlined, simplified and formulated sauce that you can keep in a bottle.

WHY:  This is actually the dish that inspired me to create this series in the first place.  As previously confessed, we eat this noodle possibly more often than any other single item on the menu, so much as that I’ve been wanting, for quite some time, to coordinate its previously tedious components into a single, cohesive formula, one that I could literally grab from the fridge and dress the noodles in one stroke.

HOW:  After some considerations, I’ve removed the one component from the original recipe that may deter some people from trying it out, and that is to render chicken fat, aka schmaltz, from chicken skins and such.  The animal fat would obviously provide an added aroma and richness to the dish, but for practicality sake, I’ve concluded that properly treated vegetable oils could bring the noodles to close standings as well, by dialing up on the uniquely floral fragrance from Sichuan peppercorns.  Then instead of having the fried shallots as a loose component, I blended it together with the rest of the seasonings to create an one-stop, fiercely aromatic, savory, spicy and tingling oil sands if you will, that properly adheres to the noodles of your choosing in a perfect ratio of smooth grit and grease.

If you haven’t been touched by the promise of fried shallots, no thanks needed.  If you haven’t been called to the light of Sichuan chili paste, the mothership of Sichuan cuisines, the pleasure’s all mine.  If you find yourself utterly powerless to pull away from this potentially addictive dope which costs nothing and goes everything, that you need to pour it down the trash before burning it with lighter’s fuel to stop yourself from salvaging… well, I offer no apology as well.

INSTANT CRACK SLURP MIX

Ingredients
6 small shallots
1 cup (205 grams) canola oil
3 small scallions, cut into segments
1/4 cup (80 grams) sichuan douban chili paste
1/2 cup (140 grams) soy sauce
1 tbsp + 1 tsp (20 grams) balsamic vinegar
2 tsp (10 grams) fish sauce
1 1/2 tsp light brown sugar
1 1/2 tbsp ground sichuan peppercorns
1/2 tsp ground white pepper

Instructions
1. Peel the shallots, then cut them into evenly thin slices. I like to do this with the thickest setting
on a truffle shaver, but you could also do it with the slicer-attachment on your food-processor.
The thinness of the slices is not as important as the evenness, but make sure they are
NO thicker than 1/8" (3 mm).
2. Place a fine sieve over a large bowl, set aside. Transfer the sliced shallots into a NON-STICK
pot (or else it will burn on the rest of the steps) with canola oil, and set over high heat. Once the
oil starts to bubble, turn the heat down to medium-low. Stirring and swirling the pot almost
constantly, and cook until the shallots are shriveled and medium golden browned, about 10~13
minutes. They will not feel crispy at this point, but don't worry, they will crisp up during
cooling. Drain the fried shallots through a fine sieve and reserve the oil. Use two chopsticks or
forks to fluff up the fried shallots to maximize aeration. You'll notice that they continue to darken
in color, which is why we want to take them off heat when they are only medium browned. Set
the fried shallots aside to cool.
3. Add 2 tbsp of the frying oil back into the same pot (no need to wash) and set over medium-high
heat. Add the scallions and cook until they are almost charred on the edges. Then add the
sichuan douban chili paste, and cook for 2 minutes until fragrant. Transfer the mixture into a
blender, along with soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, fish sauce and light brown sugar. Set aside
4. Now add all the frying oil into the same pot (no need to wash) and set over high heat. Add
ground sichuan peppercorns and ground white pepper, and cook for about 20 seconds.
Transfer all the oil into the blender as well, along with the reserved fried shallots. Run for 1~2
minutes until the sauce is smoothly pureed. Transfer into an air-tight container and kept in the
fridge until needed. Due to its high sodium content, I'm going to say it'll keep for up to 2 months.
5. To make the noodles, you can use any type of dried Asia noodles that you prefer. If you can find
those bricks of ramen noodles without seasoning packets, that would work great as well. Once
you cook the noodles according to directions, generously dress them with instant crack slurp
mix (mix well before using). The amount of largely depend on the types/thickness of the noodle
you use. But don't be shy about it. If you'd like, you can dress up the noodle with fresh scallions
or grated garlic as well. A fried egg never hurt.

MALAYSIAN MAMAK FRIED CHICKEN
Ingredients
8 pieces chicken legs and thighs
2 1/2 tbsp (57 grams) Malaysian dried shrimp paste/belacan (if unavailable, replace with 2 tbsp
Thai shrimp paste)
1 can (400 ml) coconut milk
3" (70 grams) ginger, cut into chunks
2 large lemongrass stalk, cut into pieces
3 small shallots, peeled
3 cloves garlic, smashed
1 kaffir lime leaves
4 tbsp fish sauce
1 tbsp curry powder
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp salt
1 tsp palm sugar, or dark brown sugar
1/2 tsp ground white pepper
1 cup (135 grams) all-purpose flour
1 cup (115 grams) rice flour
1 cup (120 grams) cornstarch, or potato starch
2 tbsp curry powder
2 tsp ground black pepper
2 tsp ground white pepper
1 tsp ground cayenne powder
1/2 tsp salt
Instructions
1. Wrap the Malaysian shrimp paste (or called belacan) in foil, and roast in a preheated
400F/200C oven for 10~15 min. Then add it to a blender along with coconut milk, ginger,
lemongrass, shallots, garlic, kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, curry powder, ground cumin, salt,
palm sugar (or dark brown sugar), and ground black pepper. Blend until smooth. Marinate
chicken legs and thighs in this mixture in the fridge for at least 6 hours to overnight.
2. Bring the chicken out to room-temperature 2 hours before cooking.
3. Evenly mix all-purpose flour, rice flour, cornstarch, curry powder, black pepper, white pepper,
cayenne powder and salt in a large bowl. Leave a thin coating of the marinate on each pieces of
chicken, then drench them lightly in the breading. Pat on each piece to get rid of excess
breading then set aside on a tray.
4. Add enough oil to a frying-pot until it reaches 2" deep, then heat to 330F/165C over mediumhigh heat and keep the temperature there. Fry the chickens without crowding the pot, chicken
legs for around 7~8 minutes and chicken thighs for around 10 min, until golden browned on all
sides. You can keep the fried chickens warm in a 320F/160C oven while you fry the rest. If you
can get fresh curry leaves, fry them until crispy and season with a bit of salt, and serve with the
fried chickens.
Notes
A long and sufficient marinating-time is quite important. I would suggest overnight, or at leat 6 hours.

CRACKLY PORCHETTA SANDWICH W/
SWEET BLUE CHEESE
The porchetta is said to be stuffed with chopped fennels and herbs. I have great difficulty finding fresh fennels (not
the bulb but the fronds) in HK, and therefore improvised with fennel seeds and etc. You can replace the fennel
seeds with 2 large handfuls of fennel fronds.
Ingredients
5.4 lbs (2450 grams) skin-on pork belly
zest of 1 lemon
1 1/2 tbsp salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp fennel seeds
8~10 fresh bay leaves
8~10 fresh sage leaves
2 cloves garlic
1 tsp caper
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp fish sauce, or 2 fillets of anchovies
1 tsp honey + 2 tsp water
ciabatta breads or sliced loaf bread
sweet and creamy gorgonzola cheese
Instructions
1. MARINATE THE PORK BELLY: Trim the pork belly so it has even and straight edges. Mix
together lemon zest, salt and black pepper, then rub the mixture evenly over the pork belly on
all sides. Place the pork belly SKIN-SIDE UP on a sheet-tray. Loosely tuck some plastic-wraps
on the sides to cover the meat, but LEAVE THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE SKIN EXPOSED,
then place inside the fridge for at least 20 ~ 24 hours. This duration is not only important for
marinating, but it also allows the skin to dry up in the fridge which is CRUCIAL for
crispiness.
2. TO COOK THE PORCHETTA: Preheat the oven on 300 F/150 C (I used an oven with the fan
on). With a damp towel, rub off /remove any excess salt and zests sticking on all sides of
the pork belly, as cleanly as you can (do it twice if needed), then set aside. Toast the fennel
seeds in a skillet over medium heat until it starts to pop and smell fragrant, then grind in a spicegrinder or mortar until finely ground. Set aside. Remove the tough middle stems from the bay
leaves, then combine them with sage leaves, garlics, capers and sea salt (and anchovies if
using), and chop until finely minced. Combine the mixture with ground fennel seeds and fish
sauce, then evenly rub it on top of the meat-side of the pork belly.
3. Roll the belly as tightly as you can into a log, then tie it together with kitchen twines (to learn
how to do a simple butcher's netting, check out this post). Place it on a baking-sheet then bake
in the oven for 1:30 hour. Now remove the baking-sheet from the oven, then turn the
temperature up to 400 F/200 C. Mix honey and water together, then brush it evenly over the
skin (this will give you that dark amber color). Return the baking-sheet back in the oven and
bake for another 1 hour, brushing the skin with honey-water every 20 min or so. IF YOUR
OVEN HEATS UNEVENLY, MOVE THE PORK BELLY AROUND. Once done, transfer the
pork belly to a chopping board to rest for 15 min.
4. The porchetta is best served within 1 hour after it's rested, or else the skins will become soggy
and tough.

5. TO MAKE THE SANDWICH: This step is a no-brainer. Chop up and pile a good mount of
porchetta in between breads (preferably ciabatta, toasted if you like), then add a good smear of
that creamy, dolce gorgonzola cheese on top. A bit of pepper, beer, set.

MY SUNDAY ROAST
Ingredients
106 oz (3 kg) bone-in short ribs
1/4 (75 grams) Dijon mustard
6 shallots, peeled
8 cloves garlic, smashed
1" square (2.5 cm square) ginger, peeled
1 tbsp salt
1/4 cup (22 grams) ground coffee beans
1/4 cup (26 grams) coarsely ground black peppercorns
2 tbsp (15 grams) smoked paprika
1 tbsp salt
6 tbsp (84 grams) short-ribs dripping, or unsalted butter
6 tbsp (47 grams) all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tbsp curry powder
2 tsp onion powder
1 tsp light brown sugar
1 cup (245 grams) plain yogurt
2 large eggs
1 cup (230 grams) whole milk
1 cup (125 grams) cake flour (9% protein), or replace 1 tbsp of all-purose flour with cornstarch
1/2 tsp salt
6~8 tsp short-ribs drippings, or lard, chicken fat, canola oil
ground white pepper to season
2 large handful (47 grams) fresh mint leaves
1 small handful (20 grams) fresh cilantro leaves
6 shallots, thinly sliced
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 tsp lemon juice
2 tsp fish sauce
Instructions
1. ROAST SHORT-RIBS: Puree the Dijon mustard, shallots, garlics, ginger and salt in a foodprocessor until smooth. Place the bone-in short ribs inside a deep baking-pan, then evenly rub
the mustard-mixture all over the ribs. Mix together ground coffee, coarsely ground black
peppercorns, smoked paprika and salt, then evenly coat the ribs with a thin layer of this spicmixture. We only want a thin coating, so you might have some mixture left (use it on a steak!).
Cover with plastic-wrap and let the ribs marinate for several hours or overnight in the fridge if
you can (so start in the morning or the night before). Preheat the oven on 330 F/165 C. Cover
the baking-pan tightly with foil, then roast in the oven for 4:30 to 5 hours, until a fork can be
easily inserted into the meat.
2. Carefully remove the short-ribs into another warm plate, then cover tightly with foil to keep
warm. Transfer all the drippings (fat) and juices left in the baking-pan into a measuring-cup.
Skim off all the drippings that float to the top, and reserve. You should have about 2 cups of
juice left (if not, add chicken stock to make it to 2 cups).
SUNDAY ROAST SHORT-RIBS:
CURRIED GRAVY:
YORKSHIRE PUDDING: adapted from Allrecipes.com
HERB SALAD:
1/17/2020
2/2
3. MAKE CURRIED GRAVY: In a sauce-pot over medium heat, cook 6 tbsp of drippings (my
short-ribs were particularly lean and I didn't get much dripping, so I made up the rest with
unsalted butter) with flour, curry powder and onion powder for 1 min. Add the reserved juices
from roasting, and whisk constantly until it comes to a simmer and thickened. Add the plain
yogurt and whisk until warmed through, then turn off the heat (do not let boil). Cover and set
aside until needed.
4. MAKE YORKSHIRE PUDDING: Start the batter while the short-ribs are roasting, AT
LEAST 1~2 HOURS before the ribs come out of the oven. The one most important thing I've
learnt from my several trials/failures at making this recipe, is that the batter MUST REST. If your
Yorkshire pudding didn't rise, chances are, the batter didn't rest long enough. Most recipes say
20 min but I say AT LEAST 40 min to ideally 1 hour if not longer.
5. In a container or jar that's easy to pour, whisk eggs and milk together until well and evenly
blended (some recipes say whisk till foamy, but really, I find it having nothing to do with the rise
what so ever). Add the cake flour (makes fluffier puddings) and salt, then whisk gently until you
have a loose but smooth batter with bits of tiny lumps. Cover with plastic-wrap, then let rest for
at least 40 min to 1 hour (I've even tried making the batter the night before and kept covered in
the fridge, sky-high, my friend).
6. When the short-ribs are done roasting, increase the oven temperature to 375 F/190 C. Add 1
tsp of short-ribs dripping (or lard, chicken fat, canola oil) into each muffin-holes but leaving one
empty in between each (the pudding will need room to expand)(if using a Yorkshire puddingmold, then this is not a concern). Once preheated, place the muffin-pan inside until the
drippings are smoking, about 5~10 min. If there is foam on the surface of the batter, gently
remove it with a spoon (it creates jagged surface that gets burnt) without stirring the batter. Pour
the batter right into the centre of each mold until about 70% full. The dripping should be
pushed aside and insulate/surround the batter from around the mold. This is important
not only that it makes a crispier crust, but it prevents sticking which, EVEN JUST A
LITTLE BIT, will drag the pudding down from a good rise.
7. Now bake for 30~35 min until puffed, set and golden browned on all sides, and don't open the
oven during the entire process. Nothing too exciting will happen in the first 5~10 min so don't
panic. And by around 25 min or so, the puddings may look puffed and done, but they're not.
The interiors are still undercooked and unstable, so opening the oven or removing them will
result in major deflating. They must bake for a full 30~35 min. You can increase the temperature
to 410 F/210 C for the last 5 min to get a darker browning. Out of the oven, transfer to a cooling
rack and immediately dust with some ground white pepper. Must. Eat. Fast.
8. MAKE HERB SALAD: Mix fresh mint leaves, cilantro leaves and thinly sliced shallots together,
then toss with extra virgin olive oil to coat (before adding the lemon juice and fish sauce).
Add the lemon juice and fish sauce, and toss to combine.
9. TO SERVE: Pour a generous puddle of curried gravy over the short-ribs and inside the hollow
Yorkshire puddings, then eat them with a bit refreshing highlights from the herb salad.

PORK CHOP W/ TUNA-SANDO SAUCE
Ingredients
one 200 grams canned tuna in oil, from a sustainable source or else forget it
1 large egg yolk
1 tbsp whole milk
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1 1/2 tsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp ground white pepper
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
3 tbsp store-bought mayonnaise
1 tbsp drained capers
1 small shallot, peeled and roughly cut
1 fillet of anchovy
1/2 tsp fish sauce, plus more to adjust
1/4 tsp light brown sugar
two 2 1/2" (6 cm) thick-cut boneless pork chops
sea salt and ground black pepper to season
2 tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter
4 fresh bay leaves
2 cloves garlic, smashed
marinated green olives to serve
Instructions
1. MAKE TUNA-SANDO SAUCE: Drain the oil from the canned tuna into a 1/2 cup measuring
cup. You'll probably have about 2 tbsp of it, then add however much canola oil that's needed
to make up to 1/4 cup, set aside. In a blender, add egg yolk, whole milk, Dijon mustard, lemon
juice, white and black pepper. Close the lid and turn the blender on (use the low-speed setting if
available). Through the feeding hole on the lid, slowly drizzle in the tuna oil into the blender to
form an emulsion. The mixture will likely splatter through the feeding hole, so I like to hold a
towel around it to keep it as contained as possible. Afterward, scrape down the sides of the
blender. You'll have a mixture resembling a very loose mayonnaise.
2. Now add the reserved tuna, store-bought mayonnaise, drained capers, shallot, anchovy, fish
sauce and light brown sugar, and blend on high until the sauce is extremely smooth and silky.
You can make the sauce ahead of time, kept in an air-tight container in the fridge. Before
serving, I'd like to run it in the blender again to bring it back to room-temperature (friction
creates heat).
3. MAKE PORK CHOPS: With a sharp knife, split the pork chop horizontally right through the
middle, leaving only a thin strip attached at the end so you can open it up like a book.
Season sparingly with sea salt and black pepper, set aside.
4. Heat a large, flat skillet (that will fit both pork chops comfortably) over medium-high heat. Add
olive oil and 1/2 of the unsalted butter (the skillet should be hot enough that the butter sizzles
immediately), then add the pork chops, and scatter the fresh bay leaves and garlics around. DO
NOT MOVE THE PORK CHOPS, instead, swirl the skillet and move the bay leaves and garlics
around to distribute the fat around the pork chops. When you see that the bay leaves and
garlics have become crispy and browned, remove from the skillet and set aside. With a large
spoon, periodically spoon the fat over the chops, and cook until the first side is deeply
caramelized. Now turn the pork chops over, and add the rest of the unsalted butter. With the
same motion, cook until the second side is deeply caramelzed as well. This should leave the

PORK CHOP: for 2 servings

2/2
center of the chops still slightly pink. Remove the pork chops from the skillet and let rest for 6
min.
5. Serve the pork chops garnished with the crispy bay leaves and garlics, and a generous dousing
of the tuna-sando sauce. I like to dust it with chili flakes as well. A few marinated green olives
cuts through the richness nicely.
Notes
I used Marks & Spencer, certified sustainable canned tuna in oil.
I couldn't find a thick-cut pork chop that day so I used a pork-shoulder steak instead. Either one
works, but the pork shoulder has more fat-marbles, which isn't a bad thing.
