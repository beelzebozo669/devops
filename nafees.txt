Pilchard Curry
Pilchards from a tin, with a few Indian spices to create a really quick, nutritious yet cheap meal - really delicious!
Hari says
This brings back so many memories of childhood for me.  We all loved this fish curry but it's only recently I realised that mum would cook this when times were hard and money was tight.
It's a great dish because you don't even have to add tomatoes, they are already in the sauce.
All it needs is a few choice spices to bring it to life - simple, quick, nutritious and a really cheap meal that's packed full of goodness and flavour.

Ingredients
2 x 425g tin of pilchard in tomato sauce
1 tbsp oil
1 onion, sliced
½ tsp carom seeds
2 cloves of garlic, sliced
2 tsp ginger, grated
1 chilli, chopped
1 tsp salt
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp fenugreek
Handful of fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Heat oil in a pan and add carom seeds. When the carom seeds start to sizzle add the sliced onion and garlic then fry until lightly brown.

Reduce the heat and add ginger, chilli, turmeric, salt, fenugreek and fry until aromatic (about 5 mins). If the spices stick just add a dash of water to loosen.

Open the tin of pilchards and pour in the tomato juice keeping the fish behind.

Cook everything to create a thick masala paste which becomes nice and shiny.

Gently place the fish into the masala and heat. Be careful not to stir as you don't want the fish to break up. If it looks a little dry, add some hot water.

Remove from the heat and add garam masala and a good pinch of coriander to serve.

Amchoor Stuffed BangunSave

Baby aubergines smeared in spices and tangy dried mango powder then baked
Hari says
Aubergines are a great vegetable and I especially love these little miniature ones. This dish is simple to prepare and it makes a wonderful side dish. All you need are some ground spices and a flat pan or oven tray. Ideally, if you can get hold of amchoor (dried mango powder) then that is great but if not then a tiny squeeze of lemon juice at the end will have to do. Slice them, coat them, bake them - Done!

Ingredients
1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp cumin seeds crushed
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp chilli powder
1 tsp mango powder (amchoor)
½ tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
8 baby aubergine
3 tbsp mustard oil

Method
Mix all the spices & salt together in a bowl.

Slit the aubergines with a cross.

Heat oil in a heavy based pan with a lid.

Stuff the spice mix into the inside flesh of the auberines.

Rub the outside of the aubergines with any remaining spice mix.

Place them in the pan and cover the pan. Leave them to cook on a gentle heat.

Turn over using some tongs after about 10 minutes. Turn again after another 10 minutes. Cook them for about 25-30 mins until they are soft and tender.

N.B These can also be cooked in the oven just bake for 30-40 minutes at 180ºC.

Monkfish Curry

Monkfish in a spiced coconut curry
Hari says
A robust fish curry that uses some very South Indian flavours. The mustard and fenugreek seeds combine to give this masala a unique quality all of which melts into a delightful creamy coconut sauce. I have added the option to spice this up with some fresh green chillies if you prefer a spicy dish.  Monkfish plays the perfect centrepiece to this dish because it's a chunky white fish with firm flesh that doesn't break up easily. It has a natural delicate flavour which is able to draw in all the aromas from the masala making you feel like you are sitting on a deckchair soaking up the Indian sunshine. You can also add prawns to this dish too which is lovely. The squeeze of lime adds a little zing that is super tasty. 

Ingredients
800g of monkfish fillet, cut into cubes
4 tomatoes, roughly chopped
200ml of hot water
1 tbsp coconut oil
½ tsp of black or brown mustard seeds
½ tsp of fenugreek seeds
10 fresh curry leaves or 15 dried
1 inch piece ginger, cut into julienne
1 onion, finely sliced
3-4 green chillies, sliced
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp cumin seeds
3 tsp of coriander seeds
1 tsp of Kashmiri chilli powder 
100ml of coconut milk
1 tsp salt
1 lime

Method
Wash the monkfish cubes and leave to drain.

In a blender, pulse the tomatoes into a purée with 200ml of water and set aside.

Slice the ginger, chillies and onions.

Heat 1 tbsp of coconut oil over a medium heat, then add in the mustard seeds.

Once they are crackling, stir in the fenugreek seeds followed by the curry leaves.

Dont let the fenugreek seeds colour then add the ginger, sliced onions and chillies. Stir and leave to cook until the onions are golden brown (10 minutes).

Stir in the puréed tomatoes and increase the heat.

Crush the cumin and coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar and add to the sauce with the turmeric and chilli powder.

Partially cover the pan and turn up the heat so that it starts to boil, leave the tomatoes to reduce and thicken for about 10-20 minutes.

Turn down the heat and pour in the coconut milk and salt to taste. Bring the curry back to the boil and reduce to a simmer.

Place in the pieces of fish and allow it to cook for about 2-3 minutes until the fish is just cooked through, then remove from the heat.

Squeeze in the juice of lime and check the seasoning. Serve immediately with some plain Basmati rice.

Chunky white fish marinated in lime, ginger and garlic, coated in a spiced gram flour batter then fried until golden.
Hari says
I do like fish, but I wouldn't want it every day. Then again, it's low in fat and high in protein - so I've been trying to use it in different ways. And this is one of the best. I don't cook it very often, but every time I do I remember how amazing it is and then I promise I'll make it more in the future. 

These pakoras have to be eaten straight away – the batter is so light and crispy it's a crime to leave them sitting for long. And if you're still not sure about making this one, it's basically an Indian version of chip shop fish. Just a tiiiiiiiiiiiiny bit classier.

To get the main ingredients for my Pakora recipe, check our my curry kit here.


Ingredients
400g white fish loin, cut into large chunks

Marinade
1 tsp garam masala
½ tsp salt
Juice from ½ lime or lemon
1 tbsp ginger, grated
2 cloves garlic, pounded
1 chilli, finely chopped

Batter
100g gram flour, sieved
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
1 tsp carom seeds (alternatively use cumin seeds)
1 tsp chilli powder
Handful coriander, chopped
Water
Rapeseed oil for frying

Method
Remove moisture from the fish by drying on kitchen paper.

Make up a marinade paste with the lime/lemon, salt, ginger, garlic, garam masala and chopped chilli. The marinade should be a dry paste.

Rub the marinade all over the fish and leave refrigerated for at least 30 minutes, but the longer the better.

Sieve the gram flour into a separate bowl and add carom seeds, salt, coriander, chilli powder, baking powder and a little water to make a thick batter. Beat to aerate the mixture.

Heat oil in a wok or karahi to a medium heat. (Note: if the oil is too hot the batter will cook too quickly and the fish will remain uncooked.)

Dip one of the marinated fish pieces into the batter to cover and very gently place in the hot oil. Leave to cook for about three minutes, use a slotted spoon to move the pakora around.

Once crisp and golden brown remove and set on some kitchen paper.

Taste to check the seasoning, adjust if required.

Continue to cook the rest in small batches.

Serve with salad and a wedge of lemon.

Served with

I have always been very clear about my love for the fish finger sandwich and although this should be served to your adoring friends as a nibble with a spiced yoghurt dip, I have been known to throw these into a bap with some chilli sauce, curl up on the sofa and just be in my happy place!

Mackerel Fry
Mackerel coated with an aromatic masala rub, then pan fried until crispy.
Hari says
I think mackerel is a beautiful fish. Its distinctive coat of shimmering purple, silver and green is stunning to look at, it’s packed to the gills (ha ha) with goodness and it's a tasty way to get lots of good healthy fish oils into your body. I like to add a range of different spices to my fish to give it some warmth and really delicious flavours.

Quick and easy to prepare, this makes a lovely light supper dish and works really well with a fresh and punchy radish salad. I’ve used whole mackerel in this recipe but if fish bones aren't your thing, then you can use the same marinade with fillets instead. Cook this gently to maximise the infusion of the masala paste, then crisp the fish up by turning up the heat. Finally, pour a little oil over the fish to finish the dish beautifully.

Ingredients
5 black peppercorns
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp coriander seeds
½ tsp turmeric
salt to taste
1 lemon
3cm piece ginger, crushed
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 whole mackeral
1 tsbp vegetable oil

Method
In a pestle and mortar crush the pepper, cumin, and coriander seeds and place into a bowl

Then crush the ginger and garlic and add to the bowl as well.

Mix in the chilli, turmeric, salt and juice from the lemon to make a paste.

Put slits down the sides of the fish and smear the paste over the fish

Cook the fish in a frying pan on a gentle heat for about 4-5 mins on each side

Pour the oil over the fish at the end and it will crisp up and serve with a radish salad

Fish Amritsari
Punjabi battered fish cooked in a spiced gram flour batter.
Hari says
True Punjabi flavours – that’s what this dish is all about. The batter is seasoned with ajwain (carom seeds), which have a delicate, thyme-like flavour, and a zesty lemon for freshness.

Growing up in Wolverhampton, Friday nights were a big deal because we got to eat fish and chips! Our favourite chippy was one run by a Cypriot family, and the owner and my dad would spend ages talking about what it was like being an immigrant in the UK… while us kids did the really important stuff of breathing in that gorgeous salt and vinegar smell I still love today. My mum would indulge us now and again and make home-made fried fish like this. In fact, I had no idea it was an 'actual dish with a real name' until recently. I thought it was just something mum did! What’s even worse is that as kids we preferred Mr Pafeeti’s chip shop fish because mum’s was too Indian. The shame…

Ingredients
4cm piece of ginger
4 cloves of garlic
2 lemons
½ tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tsp carom seeds (ajwain)
1 tsp chilli powder
salt to taste
200g gram flour (chickpea flour)
water
400g fish (any firm white fish) in thick portion sizes
oil to deep fry

Method
Crush the ginger and garlic to a paste and add to a large bowl.
Add the juice from 1 lemon and cut the second one into wedges to serve the fish with.
Add the turmeric, crushed cumin and coriander, carom, chilli and salt.
Sprinkle in the gram flour and mix all the ingredients for the batter together.
Add a a little water at a time to make a thick batter.
Place the fish in the batter and coat it all - leave to marinate for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile begin to heat the oil in a fryer gently
When you are ready to cook check the oil is hot enough by dropping in a little batter into the oil. If it bubbles and floats to the top straight away it's ready.
Very gently place a piece of the battered fish into the oil (place it away from you so the hot oil doesn't splash up).
Fry the fish until it's cooked through and each piece is golden and crispy (about 5-6 minutes.
Remove and set on some kitchen roll to drain. Serve hot with homemade chips and a wedge of lemon.

Meaty monkfish infused in a carom flavoured yoghurt marinade.
Hari says
Monkfish is great because it's a thick, meaty fish that can take on wonderful bold flavours. This gorgeous little marinade is a take on one that I picked up for another chef. I love the different flavours that come through and the colour is beautiful too. 

Carom has a very distinct flavour which is similar to that of thyme, but it's much stronger. One thing to remember when using carom is that it can totally over-power the flavour of your dish so don't be heavy-handed with it. The mustard and honey are key in this as I think it's really important to get a little sweetness through the marinade. I love to cook this on the barbeque too to add some earthy, smokey tones - it's just a delight!

Ingredients
500g monkfish, in thick chunks
First Marinade

3cm piece ginger
3 cloves garlic
1 green chilli, chopped finely
1 tbsp oil
½ tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
juice from 1 lemon
½ tsp Ajwain seeds
1 tsp salt or to taste
Juice from 1 lemon 
Second Marinade

1 tbsp gram flour
2 cm ginger, crushed
2 cloves garlic, crushed
½ tsp turmeric powder
½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tsp garam masala 
2 tbsp yoghurt
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp oil
1 heaped tsp mustard seeds
few springs of dill

Method
First Marinade
Put the ginger and garlic into a pestle and mortar and crush them to a paste.
Mix this and all the remaining ingredients for the first marinade in a large bowl and add the pieces of monkfish. Leave this for half an hour while you prepare the second marinade.

Second Marinade
Put the gram flour into a dry frying pan and heat to roast it. keep it moving and once you can smell a sweet aroma it is ready.
Crush the ginger and garlic and place into a second bowl add the gram flour and spices except the oil and mustard seeds.
In a pan, heat the oil and toast the mustard seeds. Once they pop remove the pan from the heat and add to the bowl with the second marinade in it. Mix together until it is all combined and pour into the bowl with the monkfish. Top with the dill springs.
Mix and leave until you want to cook the fish.

To Cook
Heat the oven to 180ºC and place the fish on a baking sheet.
Cook in the over for about 15-20 minutes until it has cooked through and just started to colour.

Tandoori FishSave
Chunky fish coated in a delicious tandoori marinade.
Hari says
I don’t know what it is about the tandoori marinade that makes it so versatile it can be used with so many different ingredients. Tandoori cooking is more about the cooking style and it's the wood burning bell oven that gives these dishes their true wonder. That said, I don't want to take anything away from the heavenly fragranced yoghurt that infuses so much flavour into the food. What a winner.

Maybe it's my Punjabi roots that makes me a bit biased, but there is something pretty awesome about the strong flavours of the ginger and garlic and the creamy nature of the fresh yoghurt. So I think the tandoori marinade is something we should all know how to make. Use fresh, thick salmon chunks (the slightly oily nature keeps the dish moist) or a robust monkfish. You can even use whole fish, in which case go for sea bream, bass or red snapper. But anything fresh will work beautifully. Just remember to score the sides of the fish first to help the marinade penetrate into the flesh, then simply bake and enjoy.

To buy the main ingredients for my Tandoori, check out my curry kit here.

Ingredients
500g Salmon or monkfish, in thick chunks
1 lemon 
salt to taste
1 tsp cumin seeds
3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
4cm piece of ginger, roughly chopped
1 green chilli, chopped
1 heaped tbsp thick greek yoghurt
1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder or paprika
1 tsp garam masala
1 heaped tsp chickpea flour
1 tbsp fresh coriander finely chopped
1 tsp vegetable oil
Lemon juice to garnish
Handful of fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Add the salmon to a mixing bowl along with juice from half the lemon juice and salt and mix well

Give the cumin seeds a bash and add to the bowl.

Crush the ginger and garlic in a pestle and mortar and place into a bowl.

Add the finely chopped chilli, and the remaining marinade ingredients and mix to ensure the fish is all coated. Leave to marinate for half an hour. The fish can be skewered or cooked directly on a baking sheet.

Preheat the grill to a medium to high setting. Grill for 15 mins until it's just done (you can also bake this in the oven if too)

Once cooked squeeze over a little lemon juice and sprinkle with green coriander and serve.

Squid Pakora

Delicious deep fried squid with Indian spices and a chilli kick
Hari says
We've all had crispy battered squid rings served with aioli or tempura squid with a sweet and sour sauce but have you ever tried Indian spiced squid pakora with a mint chutney? 

Well now is your chance to give it a go and lap up the crisp chickpea batter with a subtle hint of fennel all covering nice chunky pieces of fresh squid. I think it's delicious with lashing of my Fresh Mint Chutney but you can opt for a simple mayonnaise if you prefer.

To get the main ingredients for my Pakora recipe, check our my curry kit here.

Ingredients
vegetable oil, for deep frying
250g prepared squid, body opened out, scored on the inside, then cut into chunks or cut into rings, plus the tentacles
½ tsp fennel seed
1 tsp cumin seeds
140g gram flour
½ tsp salt
1 tsp ground turmeric
7cm piece of ginger, finely grated
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 green chilli, finely chopped
juice from 1 lime
4 spring onions, finely chopped
1 tsp chilli flakes

Method
Heat the oil to deep fry the squid on a gentle heat. Line a large bowl with kitchen paper, ready to drain the squid.
Crush the cumin and fennel seeds and place into a mixing bowl.
Into the same bowl sieve in the gram flour and add the salt, turmeric, ginger, garlic, chilli, lime juice and spring onions.
Stir in a little water, a bit at a time, to get a thick batter.
Placed the prepared squid into the batter and mix it well to coat.
Check the oil is hot enough by dropping in a tiny drop of batter. If it browns and floats to the top staright away then it's ready.
Very gently slip in a few pieces of the squid and fry for about a minute until it crisps up and turns golden in colour. Lift it out the oil and drain on the kitchen paper. You can then place these onto a baking tray and put them in the oven to keep warm.
Repeat, using up the rest of the batter.
When all the pakoras are cooked, put them on a platter, sprinkle with a little salt, some chilli flakes and serve with a mint dip.

A fresh and deliciously fiery, tangy mint chutney made with mint leaves, lemon and onion and chilli.
Hari says
This is the first thing my mum had me making - from sending me out to the garden to pick the fresh mint leaves to pounding the mint and onions. I can still feel the tears from the onions being crushed. Today with my whizzy hand blender it takes 30 seconds to make. It is so simple and I cannot recommend it highly enough - it is so fresh and zingy that your whole mouth will be tingling with excitement and each mouth full will make you want more. A great accompaniment to any snack you can even cool it down by stirring in some yoghurt. Once you try it - I promise you this is something you will be making over and over again.

Ingredients
Large bunch of fresh mint leaves
1 onion cut into chunks
1 tsp salt
1 green chilli (add more for more heat)
1 or 2 lemons

Method
Slice the lemon in half and slice off the rind, remove any pips and chop the flesh into quarters.
Remove the leaves from the mint, discarding the stalks and remove the chilli stems too.  
Place the mint, lemon, salt, chillies and onion into a blender and blitz until you get a fine blended chutney.

Served with

This is a fantastic fresh mint chutney that takes seconds to make and works well as a dip with all types of nibbles. This is the most fantastic zingy chutney you will ever taste!

Creamy Mushroom Curry

This creamy mushroom curry recipe proves that healthy food can be just as decadent as calorie heavy dishes!
Hari says
I love garlic mushrooms whether they are fried and served in a burger (American style), baked in a creamy sauce (Italian Style), sautéed for Al Ajillo Tapas (Spanish style). Whichever way they are done garlic and mushrooms make a great combination.
I don't really recall an Indian version of garlic mushrooms so after a bit of research and some fun in the kitchen I put this together. This is my creamy mushroom masala recipe and it's really delicious. I decided to use yoghurt in this recipe to watch the calories but you can use crème fraîche or be a little more indulgent with some double cream. I think this is a fresh and tasty dish that fits right into the garlic mushroom arena - but if anyone has a classically Indian garlic mushroom curry recipe please do share it with me.

Ingredients
400g button mushrooms, washed
2 tbsp vegetable oil
4cm piece fresh ginger, chopped
1 large onion, peeled and diced
3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
1 green chilli
3 tbsp natural Greek yoghurt
1 tsp tomato purée
2 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ turmeric
¼ tsp salt
½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder (optional)
Handful fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a non-stick frying pan and heat over a high heat. Once hot, add 400g of mushrooms and fry them for about 3-4 minutes. By cooking them like this they will lose their rawness and will take on more flavour when they are added to the masala sauce. Empty them into a bowl and set to one side.

Either chop up the 4 cm ginger, large onion, 3 garlic cloves and green chilli very finely or blend them all in an electric grinder along with a splash of water until you have a smooth paste.

Put the remaining tbsp. of oil into the pan and heat. Once it's hot, add the chopped onion, ginger, chili and garlic. Stir and cook until it starts to just brown.

Reduce the heat and stir in 1 tbsp of the yoghurt until it melts into a sauce, then stir in a second spoonful, again leave it to melt into the sauce and do the same with the third spoonful yoghurt.

Now add 1 tsp tomato purée and fry for a minute or two.

Sprinkle in remaining spices; 2 tsp crushed coriander seeds, ½ tsp turmeric, ½ tsp salt and ½ tsp chilli powder. Stir and bring to a simmer.

Add the pre-cooked mushrooms and any juices, then stir to coat them with the sauce. If it feels dry add a splash of water.

Reduce the heat to a low setting and simmer for 5 minutes until the mushrooms are cooked through. If you want to create slightly more of a sauce then add about 100m water.

Sprinkle with some fresh coriander and serve on a thick slab of fresh toast or with some naan.

A delicious hot and sour chutney made with tamarind and delicately balanced with the sweetness of onion and carrots.
Hari says
When I was a kid it was always my job to soak (and rehydrate) the dried tamarind blocks in hot water to squidge out all the tangy flavour. My mum hated wasting anything so I had to keep flushing out the pulp until there was nothing left but the stones and the coarse casing. It took forever and I had more important things I had to be doing... like watching Top of the Pops. Aaaaanyway, years later and after having worked my way through all the tamarind pastes, sauces and concentrates, I have gone full circle and returned to using the blocks as these give the best flavour. Yes, mother, you were right! Imlee is an amazing chutney and it's really easy to make. If you like samosas then you can only ever serve them with this.

Ingredients
3 tbsp tamarind paste/100g tamarind from a block
1 tsp salt
2 tsp sugar
100ml boiling water
1 tsp garam masala
Splash of lemon juice
1 chilli (2 chillies for more heat)
1 small carrot, in chunks
1 small onion, roughly chopped

Method
If using a block of tamarind hydrate the tamarind by covering it with hot water and soak for 10 minutes. Using a fork mash to remove the flesh. Sieve and keep hold of the tamarind water.
Place tamarind, salt, sugar, garam masala, and water into a bowl and stir together.
Then put the chilli, carrot and onion into a food processor to chop finely.
Stir the finely chopped vegetables into the tamarind water.
Add a splash of lemon juice and stir together.
Refrigerate until required.
Check seasoning before serving and adjust if required.

Served with

This is a beautifully balanced chutney with hot, sweet and tangy flavours. It's great with any snack from a samosa to a dosa.

Mushy Pea Curry
Hari says
I know what you are all thinking: 'seriously, mushy pea curry?' Well, those of you who know me know that I believe that you can curry anything. So, why not have a curry that features one of my favourite things ever: mushy peas?

Peas are used in so many dishes and they make a wonderful sidekick to potatoes, paneer and even minced lamb. But, with this dish, I really wanted to celebrate the pea itself. I think this is a lovely dish and the combination of the coconut is really good with the sweetness of the peas. Now, if you are not a fan of the gorgeousness that is the mushy pea then try this with fresh podded peas, or just some frozen ones (especially in the summer).

I have used big marrowfat peas in this recipe to show you that you can cook great dishes on a budget too. I would love to hear your thoughts on this one, so please do comment below.

Ingredients
300g fresh tomatoes, roughly chopped
1 small onion, roughly chopped
150g fresh coconut
5 cloves of garlic
2 cm ginger, roughly chopped
3 fresh green chillies (amend to personal taste)
2 tbsp oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp red chilli powder
400g tin marrow fat peas or frozen peas
Salt to taste
1 tsp coriander, chopped

Method
To make the masala, blend the tomatoes, onion, coconut, garlic, green chillies and ginger to a paste with 200ml of water.
Heat oil in a pan and add the cumin seeds until fragrant.
Pour the blended mixture into the pan and cook for about 10 minutes.
Add in the turmeric and chilli powder and stir. Leave this to cook so it thickens and the starts to make a masala.
Stir in the green peas with about 50ml of water and stir.
Continue to cook until the peas are soft and cooked through. Taste and adjust the season if required.
Sprinkle with some fresh coriander to serve with some rice.

Spiced Cauliflower Rice
Hari says
Getting more vegetable and fruit into your diet is pretty important, and for those who follow a Paleo diet, cauliflower rice has been an absolute godsend. Although I'm not keen on fad diets, and my ethos is more about eating well, enjoying everything in moderation with a variety of rainbow colours has persuaded even me. I have to say, I'm loving substituting rice for the cauli option!

Cauli rice is light and makes a great alternative to have with a curry. But, it also makes a great salad and lunch option. So, here is my spiced version of cauli rice to add a bit of a caveman kick to your diet.

Print
Ingredients Method
1 medium cauliflower, shredded
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
1 tsp black mustard seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
2 dried Kashmiri chillies, each broken into 3 or 4 pieces
5cm piece ginger, finely grated
1 garlic clove, sliced
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt
2 fresh green chillies, sliced

Method
Roughly chop your cauliflower, put into a blender and blitz very quickly to get a fine shred of cauliflower.
Heat the oil in a large saucepan or karahi. When it is hot, add the mustard seeds followed by the cumin seeds and dried chillies.
Stir for about 30 seconds, then add the sliced garlic, grated ginger, turmeric and salt and fry for 30 seconds.
Stir in the cauli rice and stir-fry for about 3-4 minutes over a medium heat. Stir in the green chillies.

Jeera Pani
Cooling cumin water
Hari says
Cumin Soda, or jal jeera as it's called in India, is commonly drunk in hot countries to keep the body cool. The cumin in this recipe stimulates the digestive system, while the mint triggers the body's cooling mechanisms, the salt rehydrates and the sugar provides energy. It's super-quick to make, refreshing and has a distinctive flavour. Serve, with or without sugar, as an aperitif to wake up the taste buds before a meal, or sweeten it and enjoy as a refreshing drink on its own. If you don't fancy mint leaves floating in your glass, blend the ingredients until smooth

Ingredients
Handful of mint leaves
2 litres soda water
1 tsp toasted ground cumin 
½ tsp ground black pepper
Juice of 2 limes
Good pinch of sea salt
1 heaped tbsp sugar

Method
Bash the mint leaves between your palms to release their flavourful aroma, then place in a jug with the soda water, cumin and black pepper.
In a dish or using a pestle and mortar, mix together the lime juice, salt and sugar until the sugar has dissolved.
Add the sugar mixture to the soda water, stir until well combined (or use a blender if preferred) and serve, with or without ice, in long glasses on hot days.

A tomato relish cooked with five spices
Hari says
This is my Punjabi tomato relish which I like to keep in the fridge to have with meaty snacks such as Lamb Kebabs or Kofta Bites. I call it punjabi because it uses some classic North Indian spices such as Kasoori Methi or fenugreek leaf and Kashmiri chillies.

It is so delicious as a dip but what makes this really special is that it takes less the five minutes to put together.

Ingredients
1 fresh tomato, roughly chopped
handful of coriander, roughly chopped
3cm fresh ginger
1 tsp salt
½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder, (optional)
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp kalonji seeds
1 tsp fennel seeds
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp fenugreek leaves

Method
Place tomato, coriander, ginger into a blender and blitz to a pulp.
Heat the oil in a heavy pan and add all the spices until they sizzle & become fragrant. This should only take a minute.
Pour the pulp into the pan and heat through for a minute. Pour into a serving dish and leave to cool before serving. Store in a sealed jar and keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

A warming hot and sweet tomato chutney.
Hari says
This is my take on tomato ketchup and I like to add few Indian aromatics to make it even more wonderful - it's sweet, spicy and warming making it a delicious accompaniment for many snack dishes. It is totally delicious with Fish Pakora, Aloo Tikki and Spicy Wedges to name a few. It also works brilliantly with cheese too — so cook some up for your next dinner party to really impress your friends.

I love that it has a real festive flavour and getting in the kitchen to do a bit of seasonal cooking in December is a real pleasure for me. It's great fun cooking up these special flavours, but more than that, this chutney makes a fantastic gift for your special friends, just find a few funky jars and a bit of ribbon and hand them out for a bit of festive spirit.

Ingredients
3 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp kalonji seeds
1 tsp fennel seeds
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
½ tsp fenugreek seeds
2 dried kashmiri red chillis
1 red chilli, chopped
200ml white vinegar
250g jaggery or brown sugar
1 kg tomatoes, quartered
1 tsp salt, or to taste
1 tsp chilli powder, optional

Method
Dissolve the sugar with the vinegar in a bowl.

Heat the oil in a heavy pan and add all the spices until they sizzle & become fragrant. This should only take a minute.

Very gently, pour the vinegar and sugar mixture into the pan with the spices and stir. Bring this to a simmer.

Add in the tomatoes and cook on a very low heat until they have softened and have gone pulpy (about 45 minutes to 1 hour).

Season with salt and chilli powder then stir to keep it from sticking. If you want to remove any of the tomato skins then do so with some tongs.

Put the chutney into a sterilised glass jar and leave to cool.

Once cooled seal the jar, the chutney will keep for 4-6 weeks refrigerate once opened.

Hari says
I have seen many versions of this dish from using minced chicken balls with carrots sticks as the lollipop right through to using a whole chicken drumsticks. These are all great but I think using wings makes this that little bit more delicate.

As with everything that is special there is a bit of work needed and in this case preparing the wings which can be a bit of a fiddly job. It might even be worth making friends with your butcher as I am sure they would be more then willing to prep the wings for you.

Once prepped the chicken is left in a flavoured Indian batter to soak up some zingy flavours and warming spices. Once fried these little chicken bites make a delicious finger food that your guests will marvel at. I have tried them with a number of different spices but for this recipe it's all about the gentle aniseed flavour of fennel which lifts the crispy coating making them a little more special.

Ingredients
24 chicken wings
oil to deep fry
100g plain flour
50g corn flour
4 cloves of garlic
4 cm fresh ginger
1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder
2 green chillies
1 tsp salt
1 tsp fennel seeds
1 heaped tsp garam masala
juice of 2 lemons 
a little water

Method
Prepare the chicken by cutting the wing at the joint and scraping all the meat down to the end so the bone is clean.
Blitz the ginger, garlic and chillies and empty into a bowl
Sieve the flour into the bowl and add the salt, fennel seeds, garam masala and lemon juice.
Whisk the mixture to get a lovely smooth batter. If it is too dry add a splash of water. You are looking for a lovely thick batter that will coat the chicken.
Add the chicken to the batter and leave it to marinade for about 20 minutes
Heat oil in a heavy based pan to about 180ºC
Deep fry the chicken for about 8 minutes until the pops are a wonderful golden brown colour.
Remove and drain on some kitchen roll. They should be lovely and crisp, make sure they are cooked through before serving.

Piri Piri Sauce
A very hot and spicy pepper sauce
Hari says
Piri Piri is the Swahili word for 'pepper pepper 'and is also the word used in the Portuguese language for pepper and is also where this sauce originates. 

Although it's not Indian in flavour it is one of my favourite pepper sauces and one that I have spent a long time perfecting so it deserves to be shared. It works both as a marinade especially when roasting chicken or as just a dipping sauce. Although it is very fiery it has a wonderful acidity that makes it so special so if you like a chilli sauce this one will not disappoint.

Ingredients
5-10 fresh red chillies, depending on how hot you want it
2 dried smoked red chillies
2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
1 tsp rock salt
½ tsp oregano
½ tbsp smoked paprika
150ml olive oil
100ml red wine vinegar

Method
Preheat the oven to 180°C and put all the chillies onto a roasting tray and roast them for 10 minutes.
Roughly chop the garlic and blanch in hot water for about 4 minutes.
Once roasted let the chillies cool and roughly chop them (use gloves and then wash your hands afterwards).
Place the chillies, blanched garlic, salt, oregano, paprika, olive oil and vinegar into a small saucepan, and bring to the boil then leave to simmer for about 2-3 minutes. 
Once the mixture has cooled blend everything so it's the consistency of a fine pouring sauce. Store in a tight jar at room temperature. It will keep for about a month. Shake before using.

Lamb Burgers
The ultimate spiced lamb burger!
Hari says
I love a burger especially on a Saturday night with a glass of bubbles. It's my night to relax and indulge in some homemade junk food (which isn't junk food at all). We all love a burger and as much as we try to be healthy I don't think there is anything wrong with a homemade burger. They are super easy to make and even better to eat. But what I love is that you can be really adventurous by adding different herbs and spices to the meat patty or create the ultimate toppings and everyone can make their own — happy days!

Ingredients
400g minced lamb,
1 medium onion, very finely diced
1 tsp salt
twist of black pepper
½ tsp red chilli powder (optional)
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
2 tsp garam masala
Handful mint, finely chopped
sliced cheese

Method
Place the lamb mince in a large bowl and add all the other ingredients and mix together using your hands to ensure all the spices are evenly distributed.
Wash hands and rub them with a little oil. This helps to shape the patty and stops the mixture sticking to your hands.
Split the mixture into 4 portions and shape each one into a patty
Place the burger into a hot griddle, tava or frying pan and cook for 5-10 minutes then turn. Make sure it's cooked through and browned on the outside.
Place some sliced cheese on top of the burger and cover with a pan lid for a few seconds to steam. Remove and place on your toasted bun.
Serve with any burger accompaniments you like - for me it has to be garlic mushrooms, chilli sauce, salad and red onion rings.

Spicy Potato Wedges
Indian potato wedges that are lightly spiced and baked
Hari says
My delicious Indian chips made by very gently spicing up some potato wedges. I like mine with a light dusting of chilli but if you want them a bit more spicy the you can crank up the chilli level they are also great cooked with chilli flakes too. 

I usually served them up with fish dishes, as a side whenever I have a barbecue or with some tandoori chicken. However I serve them, I do like to dunk them into some spicy tomato chutney.

They cook pretty quickly and take no time at all to prepare, so it's a lovely way to jazz up your potatoes.

Ingredients
4 large potatoes,
1 tbsp oil
1 tsp salt
2 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp paprika

Method
Heat the oven to 180°C.
Wash and scrub potatoes then cut into chunky wedges with the skin left on.
In a large roomy bowl and all the spices and oil to make a rub. Add the potatoes and mix using your hand to coat them with the oil rub.
Place wedges on an oven tray skin side down.
Place in the oven to cook for 25-30 minuets until crisp and spicy.

Seekh Kebabs
Spiced meat on a stick - need I say more?
Hari says
These are very quick and simple kebabs to make. All you need to do is throw everything into a blender and squeeze the mixture onto skewers. These are so versatile that they can be cooked in a frying pan, on a griddle, on the barbecue and they make a fun and delicious alternative to sausages for the kids (just leave the chillies out).

These kebabs work well with either a mint chutney or a hot green sauce.

Ingredients
500g lamb mince
4 garlic cloves
10cm piece of ginger, roughly chopped
1 chilli, chopped
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tsp salt
handful of coriander (including stems)
1 tbsp oil
wooden or metal skewers

Method
In a pestle and mortar roughly crush the cumin seeds, ginger, chilli and garlic then put into a blender.
Then add the mince, garam masala, Kashmiri chilli powder, salt and coriander. Blend to paste and leave to rest in the refridgerator (or freezer) for 15 mins.
If using wooden skewers, soak in cold water for at least 30 minutes.
Coat your hands in a little oil and take a small ball (size of a walnut) of the lamb mixture and squeeze around the skewer. Set to one side and repeat with the remaining mixture. Refridgerate for at least 30 mins before cooking
Cook in a frying pan or griddle for 10 minutes then turn to cook the other side until brown and a little crispy. These are also delicious on the barbecue.
Serve with a fresh mint chutney.

Morel Mushroom Pilau
Hari says
Morel mushrooms not only look beautiful they taste fantastic too. They grow wild all over the UK and are brown in colour with an oval shaped cap and an intricate honeycomb pattern. They come into season around April time and can be used in many different dishes. Surprisingly these mushrooms are also used in India. In the Kashmir region, they are called 'gucchi’.

This pilau dish is my take on the traditional ‘gucchi pilau’. Traditionally onions wouldn't be used in this dish but I think the bite and texture they add so have used them in this recipe. The rice dish is infused with saffron soaked in a flower essence (or you can just use water) and the whole dish is studded with some exotic spices.

Ingredients
300g white basmati rice
¼ tsp saffron strands
1 tsp screw pine water (or 1 tbsp rosewater, or jasmine flower water)
150g fresh morel mushrooms
75g ghee or 3-4 tbsp rapeseed oil
½ onion, sliced
3cm ginger, sliced into thin strands 
4 black cardamoms, lightly crushed 
6 green cardamoms, lightly crushed
10cm piece cassia bark, broken
6 cloves
3 dried bay leaves
75g almond slivers
1 tsp salt
¾ litres cold water
1 tsp garam masala
fresh coriander leaves, chopped

Method
Wash the rice in several changes of cold water until the water runs clear and set to one side.
Soak the saffron strands in the screwpine water or flaower water and leave for later.
Rinse the mushrooms and cut them in half lengthways.
Heat the ghee or oil in a wide heavy-bottomed saucepan and add the whole spices with the bay leaves. Stir for a few minutes until you can smell the fragrance from the spices.
Stir in the sliced onions and cook for about 5 minutes before adding the ginger.
Next add the prepared mushrooms and almonds, and sauté for a couple of minutes until the nuts begin to brown.
Add the washed rice to the mushroom mixture and sauté for a few minutes until the grains of rice become shiny.
Pour in the saffron mixture and salt. Add the cold water and bring the rice to the boil.
Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cover with a lid. Let the rice cook undisturbed for 15 minutes.
Check to see whether the rice is cooked by pressing a couple of grains between your fingers. Remove from heat and set aside.
Sprinkle the rice with garam masala and coriander leaves just before serving.

Mushroom Biryani
Hari says
Biryanis are an absolute skill to get right and I have tried a fair few in my time. This South Indian style biryani is very different to the classic Biryani in how it is cooked and put together. Some may argue that it's not actually a biryani at all, which I do understand because unlike a traditional biryani it's not a dish of alternating rice and masala layers.

The South Indian biryani is cooked more in the style of a pilau with the rice cooked in the masala. Not being a purist, I think it's a fabulous dish and the flavours are just as fragrant. I love using slightly different spices in this dish (especially the star anise) to add the aniseed notes that are so delicious.  

I have kept it simple using chestnut mushrooms, but you can really go to town and use whatever combination of mushrooms you like.
To buy the main ingredients for my Biryani, check out my curry kit here.

Ingredients
Rice
200g basmati rice
Masala
2 to 3 tbsp oil
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp fennel
3cm piece of cassia bark
2 cloves
3 green cardamoms
2 strands of mace
1 bay leaf
1 star anise
10 curry leaves
1 onion, finely chopped
6 cloves of garlic, crushed in a mortar-pestle
7cm ginger, crushed in a mortar-pestle
1 or 2 green chillies, finely chopped
1 tomato, finely chopped
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp red chilli powder
½ tsp garam masala powder
1 tsp coriander powder
¼ tsp black pepper
1 tsp salt
250g chestnut mushrooms, cut into chunks
Handful mint leaves, chopped
Handful coriander leaves, chopped

Method
Rice
Rinse basmati rice in running water till the water runs clear of starch. Soak the rice in enough water to cover it and leave for 30 minutes. Then, drain the rice and keep aside.
Mushroom Masala
Heat oil in a deep pan, then add all the whole spices - fennel, cumin, cloves, bay leaf, cassia, green cardamoms, star anise and mace.
Stir in the curry leaves and fry the spices until fragrant for a few seconds, then add chopped onions and saute until they are translucent.
Add the minced ginger, garlic and green chillies and cook until the garlic cooks through.
Add the chopped tomatoes and saute for about 10 minutes. 
Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, red chilli powder, black pepper and salt.
Once fragrant and the tomatoes have broken down into the masala, add the mushrooms and half of mint and coriander leaves. Cook on a low heat for 6 to 8 minutes.
Stir and add about 200ml of hot water. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
Add the rice and the remaining mint and coriander and stir through. Season with salt.
Reduce the heat and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for 10 minutes.
Once the water has been absorbed, check the rice is cooked. If it still has a bite, you can add a little more water and leave to cook with the lid on for a little longer.
Once the rice is cooked through, allow the rice to sit for 5 minutes.
Remove the lid and fluff the rice.

Vegetable Pilau

A lovely all in one rice pilau, fragranced with whole spices and cooked with the vegetables of your choice.
Hari says
We Indians love our rice and we treat each grain with respect. I was always taught never to waste food and I can remember my mum telling me that without rice (meaning food) we would have nothing. This is something that has stayed with me and is something that can annoy my friends as I will not throw any food out. I think it's important and a trait I'm desperately trying to instil in my children. This is just one of many rice dishes I will be adding to the site - don't be afraid of the spice list its not a difficult dish to prepare.

Ingredients
50g peas
1 carrot (diced small)
100g mixed vegetables - mushrooms, cauliflower, sweetcorn etc
Masala
1 tbsp vegetable oil
2 medium onions, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
2 green chillies, chopped
2 bay leaves
5cm stick cassia bark
1 tbsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp coriander seeds
1 tbsp whole black peppercorns
1 tsp salt
4 cardamoms
3 cloves
2 black cardamom
Handful of mint leaves, chopped
Handful of coriander, chopped
Rice
250g basmati rice, washed
500ml water
Saffron Milk
2 pinches of saffron threads
5 tbsp of milk or warm water

Method
Wash the rice until water runs clear and set to one side.
In a small bowl add the saffron strands and pour in a splash milk. Leave the saffron to steep.
Heat the oil and add the bay leaves, cassia bark, peppercorns, cumin seeds, cardamoms, black cardamom, cloves and stir-fry for 2 minutes until the spices become aromatic.
Add chopped onions and cook until soft. Stir in the salt and cook until the onion just begin to turn golden then stir in the ginger, garlic, green chilli, mint and coriander leaves.
Add the mixed vegetables. Stir to coat and cook for a few minutes.
Add the washed rice and stir through very gently. Add the water and bring to the boil.
Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and place the lid on the pan and leave to cook for 10 minutes. Splash the saffron milk on the rice and leave the lid on the pan for a few more minutes.
Remove the lid and fork through the rice and serve.

Courgette and Onion Pakora

Courgettes and onions all wrapped up in a tasty spiced batter
Hari says
A really tasty version of the crispy gram flour fritter we all love. These are made even lighter with the addition of a little baking powder and the lovely little courgette is transformed into a fragrant spicy little bundle of joy. In the summer I'm always looking for something to do with courgettes because they are available in abundance and so delicious when in season.
I know it's naughty, but when something is already delicious if you wrap it up in spices, dip it in batter and deep fry it - then it's only going to get better.
To get the main ingredients for my Pakora recipe, check our my curry kit here.

Ingredients
2 medium courgettes coarsely grated (approx 750g total weight)
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 tsp whole cumin seeds
handful of fresh coriander, chopped
1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder (or ½ tsp paprika)
1 green chilli, chopped
1 tsp salt or to taste
100g chickpea flour (gram flour)
½ tsp baking soda
Rapeseed oil to deep fry

Method
Begin to heat the oil in a deep pan or karahi (Indian wok) on a gentle heat. Keep an eye on your oil so it doesnt get too hot and never leave it unattended.
Place the grated courgette into a muslin or clean tea towel and squeeze out the excess water, then place the drained courgette into a bowl.
When you are ready to cook add the sliced onion, whole cumin, chopped coriander, chili powder, chopped chilli and salt.
Sieve in the chickpea flour and baking soda and using one hand mix everything together. Squeeze the mixture through your fingers until it comes together as a very thick batter.
Add a splash of water too loosen the batter if it feels too stiff.
Test if the oil is hot enough by dropping in a little batter. If it bubbles and rises to the top immidiately the oil is ready.
Using a tablespoon, spoon out the mixture and very carefully drop in small balls of the batter into the hot oil. Fry the pakora and turn every so often for 4-5 minutes until they are golden brown and cooked through.
Remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon, and drain on some kitchen paper. Serve hot with a hot and tangy chutney.

This is also known as green chicken tikka which for me doesn't give this dish the credit it deserves. It's a wonderfully fragrant dish and one that works as a main or a starter. I like to serve this in a roti wrap with salad and a red hot chutney. 
The marinade is created from fresh green coriander and mint with a little ginger and garlic that are all thrown together with some thick wholesome yoghurt. Simple to make, this is a real feel good dish thats light and delicious.

Ingredients
6 chicken thigh fillets, trimmed and skinned
Marinade
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 bunch fresh coriander, leaves and stems
½ bunch fresh mint leaves,  
4 garlic cloves
3cm piece of fresh ginger
4 fresh green chillies
1 tsp salt?
½ lemon, juice only
1 tbsp oil
3 tbsp thick Greek yogurt

Method
Clean, wash and pat dry the chicken pieces.
Put the cumin seeds into a pestle and mortar and roughly crush the seeds.
Place the mint, coriander, ginger, garlic, chillies, lemon juice, salt and oil into a blender and blitz to a paste.
Empty this paste into a bowl and mix in the yoghurt and crushed cumin seeds.
Combine the chicken and the marinade and let it sit for at least 30 minutes but overnight is better.
Cook in the oven at 180°C for 25 minutes or on the barbecue for about 10-15 minutes until cooked through.

Malahi Tikka
Hari says
Marinading is a fantastic way to infuse lots of flavour into meat. This dish is one that I have seen prepared in different restaurants and I think it's pretty delicious. It's fairly unique in that it is cooked in a cream or malahi marinade using cream cheese, cream and yoghurt, which gives it a gentle mild flavour that is a great alternative to the tandoori marinade. Obviously, cooking it in a tandoor adds a wonderfully warming smokiness, but at home, baking it in the oven still works as well and it still tastes fantastic.

Ingredients
6 chicken breasts
6cm ginger 
5 gloves of garlic 
1 green chilli, chopped
1 lime, juiced
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp of cream cheese
3 tbsp of thick Greek yoghurt
3 tbsp of double cream
1 tbsp of coriander stem, chopped
½ tsp cardamom seeds, ground
½ tsp black cumin seeds
To serve
½ tsp chaat masala
1 lemon, juice

Method
Wash the chicken and leave it to drain. Using kitchen roll, ensure the chicken breasts are dry before coating in the marinade.
Cut each chicken breast into 2-3 equal sized chunks, trimming off any excess fat.
Blitz the ginger, garlic and chilli in a blender to make a paste. Add a little water to loosen if required.
Coat the chicken in the lime juice, 1 heaped tbsp of the ginger, garlic and chilli paste and salt. Mix well and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least an hour (the longer the better).
In a second mixing bowl, combine another tbsp of the ginger, garlic and chilli mix, cream cheese, yoghurt, double cream, coriander stems, black cumin and cardamom powder and mix well until combined.
Add the marinated chicken, mix again and leave in the fridge for approximately 1 hour before cooking.
Place the marinated chicken onto an oven tray and cook in the oven at 180ºC for about 15-20 minutes until cooked through.
Serve with a fresh salad, a sprinkle of chaat masala and a squeeze of lemon.

The iconic Punjabi dish is cooked with chicken pieces on the bone and flavoured with a delicate blend of tandoori spices in a yoghurt marinade - healthy and delicious!
Hari says
The iconic tandoori style chicken comes from my family's home region in India and it's a dish that we are very proud of. Our family barbeques have never involved sausages or burgers, but are instead all about tandoori chicken, lamb kebabs and spicy chutneys.

Traditionally, tandoori chicken is cooked with a whole bird that has been infused with flavour through a distinct two-stage marinading process. This involves using a wood burning clay oven that is cylindrical in shape and built into the ground. 

The tandoor oven is what gives this amazing dish its unique flavour, texture and smoky fragrance. It's the Kashmiri chillies that give it the iconic red colour (not the luminous red we are used to seeing in restaurants). As difficult as it is to replicate these flavours (I have been trialling and testing for years), I think that I have a pretty good tandoori chicken recipe here.

I am very passionate about this dish, and not only do I love to eat it, but I really enjoy putting it together too. If you have time it's great to let the chicken marinade for as long as possible but if you dont have time then you can cook it staright away too so it's a great mid week meal. So if you want to make your barbeque something special this year or just enjoy a quick, light meal in the evening give this tandoori chicken recipe a go!

Ingredients
4 chicken legs, skinned and trimmed
Marinade
1 tbsp mustard oil / rapeseed oil
1 large lemon
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 cm piece of ginger, grated
1 green chilli, finely chopped
200ml Greek yoghurt
1 tsp salt
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tbsp Kashmiri red chilli powder
1 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves.
Garnish
Handful of coriander with chopped lemon wedges

Once skinned and trimmed, slash the flesh on the legs twice, diagonally, down to the bone.
Blend the garlic, ginger, chilli in a pestle and mortar.
Place the chicken in a dish and stir in the blended ingredients. Pour on the lemon juice and the mustard oil.
In a separate dish, mix the remaining ingredients (salt, garam masala, ground cumin seeds, Kashmiri red chilli powder, dried fenugreek leaves) with the yoghurt to create a paste. Add this yoghurt paste to the chicken and massage into the meat using your hands.
Cover, refrigerate and leave for at least 30 minutes, but the longer the better. Heat the oven to 200oC.
Transfer the marinated chicken to an oven tray and cook for about 30-40 minutes. The chicken should be tender and a little charred, which helps give the smokey flavour. Even better, you can cook this on the barbecue!

Served with
I always have this chicken recipe as a starter with a green salad. The one thing you have to have with this tandoori chicken is raw onions that have been soaked in salted water, drained and then drenched in lemon juice.

No Punjabi meal is complete unless it's served with a small side dish that's pungent and flavorsome. These can be salads, chutneys or pickles made from any vegetable or fruit but what they do have in common is that they have to be hot, tangy, spicy and bring your mouth to life. 

This piyaz or onion dish does exactly that, it's zingy, nose tinglingly pungent and has a chilli kick to boot. It's the perfect accompaniment to a rich lamb curry and is equally good as a side salad with a lovely kebab.

Chapli Kebabs

Spicy beef kebabs flavoured with dry tangy pomegranate seeds and coriander
Hari says
The word kebab comes from the Arabic language and refers to cooking or burning on an open fire. It's thought that soldiers would cook meat by wrapping it onto their swords and putting the swords over the camp fires. This was a means of just eating for them but it gave the food a wonderful rustic flavour. 

This kebab comes from Afganistan but is also popular in Pakistan and what is unique about it is that it is made purely with beef and contains some key ingredients from the region such as anardana (pomegranate seeds) and coriander seeds and it's this combination that give them a unique flavour. (You can make these with minced lamb as I do.)

The mixture is formed into a flat patty that is shaped like a flip flop or 'chapal' which is where it gets it's name from and should be served with fresh tomatoes and naan (or pitta bread).

Ingredients
500g ground beef
4 tbsp whole wheat flour
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp salt
Handful fresh coriander, chopped
2 green chillies, finely chopped
1 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
1 tsp anardana (pomegranate seeds)
2 medium tomatoes,chopped
Oil for frying

Method
Place the minced beef into a bowl.
Crush the coriander, cumin and anardana seeds in a pestle and mortar or in a spice grinder and add to the bowl.
Sprinkle in the flour and add the chopped onions, chopped chillies, tomatoes, coriander, garam masala, salt and chilli powder.
Mix ingredient to combine all the flavours and form the mixture into flat patties about 1cm thick.
Heat the oil in a pan and shallow fry them for about a minute then turn them over. Once cooked through place on some kitchen roll and serve with fresh naan, a red onion salad and yoghurt.

Lamb Boti Kebabs
Tender chunks of lamb marinated in a spiced yoghurt and baked in the oven.
Hari says
Boti kebabs are made with chunks of lamb that are marinated in a spiced yoghurt which add a lovely warming depth to the meat. These can be cooked on a barbecue but are equally good in the oven. 

Ingredients
800g leg of lamb, cut into cubes
3 cardamoms 
4cm cassia bark, 
1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
4 cloves garlic, minced
Handful fresh coriander, chopped
squeeze of lime
3 tbsp greek yoghurt
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp vegetable oil

Method
Cut the meat into bite-sized cubes.
Crush the cardamoms, cassia, coriander and cumin in a spice grinder to make a powder. 
Crush the garlic in a pestle and mortar and chop the coriander.
Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl to make the fragrant marinade.
Stir the meat into the marinade to coat it. Leave in the refrigerator for at least an hour so the flavours infuse. 
Thread the marinated meat pieces onto the skewers leaving a gap between them. Keep any remaining marinade for basting.
When you are ready to cook pre-heat the oven to 180ºC.
Place the kebabs on an oven tray and cover with foil. Put the tray in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.
Remove the foil and turn the kebabs over and coat with the remaining marinade.
Put the tray back in the oven and leave the kebabs to cook for another 10-20 minutes until the meat is soft and tender.

This is a classic, vibrant yet gently spiced dish that's just plain delicious.
Hari says
I love to make this little snack - sometimes really simply with just chicken thigh pieces that are marinaded and other times I like to use colourful peppers, mushrooms and red onions.

The chicken is left to marinate in a spiced yoghurt along with some vegetables and then skewered and cooked on a griddle or under the grill. The wonderful warming red colour of the meat comes from the delightful kashmiri chilli powder. This adds a little heat, but not too much as well as a slight smokiness making this a lovely dish to share with friends. It's also one of my summer staples as it barbecues beautifully - so easy to prepare and a fun one to get the children involved in too.

Ingredients
5-6 chicken thighs/4 breasts
1 red pepper, cut into chunks
1 green pepper, cut into chunks
2 red onions, cut into chunks
Marinade
1 tsp salt
3 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tbsp ginger, grated
1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder
1 fresh chilli, finely chopped (2 for more heat)
1 tsp of garam masala, heaped
1 tsp of dried fenugreek leaf (kasoori methi)
½ tsp of coriander seeds, crushed
4 cardamoms, crushed
250g Greek yoghurt (ideally hung yoghurt)
Juice from 1 lemon
Mustard oil (for brushing)
Handful of fresh coriander, chopped
6 skewers - metal or wooden

Method
Cut the chicken into large chunks. 
Mix all the marinade spices in a dish and add the yoghurt, stir together.
Place the chicken and chopped vegetables in the marinade and using your hands rub the yoghurt all over them.
Refrigerate and leave to marinade for at least one hour.
Heat the oven to 200oC. If using wooden skewers soak them in cold water for about 20 minutes.
Skewer the meat and vegetables. Place the chicken skewers onto a baking tray and brush with oil and place on the middle shelf in the oven. Cook for 10-15 minutes.
Turn the skewers over and brush or drizzle with oil. Return to the top shelf of the oven for another 15 minutes.
Garnish with coriander and a good squeeze of lemon juice to serve.

Chicken Shashlik
Hari says
Shashlik is basically like a shish kebab, which translates to skewered meat and is a dish that was popular in central and South Asia. Shish were generally made using chunks of lamb, but chicken kebabs have become just as popular. This has a slight Chinese-style twist to the marinade with the use of soy. For this dish, it's all about balancing the sweet, sour, salt and chilli flavours.

I love finding out about the history of dishes, and like most food that travels across the world, this picked up little adaptations along the way. Once it touched the shores of India, it was transformed into a curry dish as well as a skewered BBQ-style dish.

For me, I like the kebab style more and love to cook the kebabs on the BBQ, just as it was intended to be cooked to get the delicious smoky flavour. However, if you want to turn this into a curry too, I will also go through in the method for how you can make the masala sauce.

Ingredients
5-6 chicken thighs
1 green pepper, cut into chunks
2 red onions, cut into chunks
Marinade
4 cloves garlic, pureed
2 tbsp ginger, pureed
1 fresh chilli, finely chopped (or 2 for more heat)
4 tbsp white vinegar
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tsp of garam masala
3 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp mustard paste
2 tbsp tomato ketchup
½ tsp salt, black pepper
Oil
Handful of fresh coriander, chopped
6 skewers
As a curry
2 garlic cloves, sliced
2 tomatoes, pureed

Method
Cut your chicken and vegetables into large chunks so they can be easily skewered.
Blitz the ginger, garlic and fresh chilli to make a paste and place into a large bowl.
Add the vinegar, chilli powder, garam masala, soy sauce, mustard paste and tomato ketchup.
Mix to create a lovely tangy marinade before adding the chicken and vegetables. Stir the whole lot together and leave to marinade for 30 minutes to an hour.
Once you are ready to cook, skewer alternate pieces of the vegetables and meat onto the skewers.
To cook, you can either place the skewers onto a BBQ or onto an oven tray to bake in the oven. Cook until the chicken is cooked through (15-20 minutes) and the vegetables are slightly charred.

To make it as a curry
Heat oil and gently fry 2 cloves of sliced garlic for a minute. Do be careful not to burn them.
Blitz 2 tomatoes in a blender and add to the garlic. Cook for 5-10 minutes until the tomatoes lose their acidity. 
Add the marinated chicken and cook for 10 minutes before adding the marinated vegetables.
Cook for a further 10 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened and becomes sticky, but the vegetables maintain a little crunch.
Serve with some steamed rice.

Hari says
It's great to have a thick spicy sauce with many different types of dishes. This one you can use as a dipping sauce for kebabs or as a base sauce with a grilled steak. Robust and meaty it's fairly simple to cook too.

Ingredients
2 tbsp mustard oil
Large pinch asafoetida
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 stick of cassia bark
3 cloves
2 whole dried Kashmiri chillies
2 black cardamoms
2 green cardamoms
1 tsp salt
1 tsp red Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tsp hot chilli powder (optional)
1 tsp ginger powder
1 tsp fennel powder
4 tomatoes, chopped
3 heaped tbsp Greek yoghurt
50ml water (approx.)
1 tsp garam masala

Method
Heat the mustard oil to smoking point. Leave to cool then reheat and add the asafoetida.
Add all the whole spices - cumin seeds, cassia, cloves, whole dried Kashmiri chillies, black and green cardamoms and salt to taste.
Once the spices become fragrant add tomatoes and fry until they become thick and pulpy.
Reduce the heat and add the chilli powder with the ginger and fennel powders.
Stir in the yoghurt 1 tablespoon at a time. Once mixed through place the lid on the pan and leave on the lowest heat setting to simmer gently for a few minutes. Add a little water if required but you want this to be nice and thick so nit too much.
Once thickened add the garam masala and leave to cool a little.
Using a hand blender blend to a smooth sauce and serve as a dipping sauce

Steamed fish patties, infused with garlic and lemon then fried in a mustard oil until crisp.
Hari says
The great thing about this recipe is that it's an unusual way to cook fish, yet it looks and tastes absolutely amazing. I always marinate my fish in lemon, salt and turmeric to add a little zing to the dish and heighten the finished flavour. Another tip is to ensure you cook the gram flour until it releases a sweet aroma and turns a touch darker. This toasts the flour and so adds a slight nuttiness to the kebabs. And until you try the fish and mustard oil combo, don't knock it. It is just delicious.

Ingredients
150g salmon, skinned and boned
250g white fish, skinned and boned
½ tsp salt, or to taste
Juice 1 lemon
2 cloves garlic
3-4 tbsp mustard oil for frying
2 tbsp gram flour
4cm piece ginger, grated
2 green chillies, finely chopped
Handful of fresh coriander, finely chopped
1 tsp black peppercorns, cracked
½ tsp turmeric powder

Method
Cut the fish into chunks, sprinkle with salt and the lemon juice.
Place the marinated fish in a steamer with the roughly crushed garlic and the squeezed lemon.
Once you have added water to the steamer begin to cook the fish for about 5-7 minutes. Then remove from the heat and leave to cool.
Place most of the steamed fish and the garlic into a food processor and blend until smooth. Keep some of the steamed fish in the larger chunks for texture.
Place all the fish into a large bowl and set to one side.
Toast the gram flour in a frying pan on a gentle heat. Keep it moving in the pan until it turns a shade darker and you can smell a slightly sweet fragrance (about 5 minutes) then remove from the heat.
Into the bowl with the fish add the ginger, chillies, salt, fresh coriander, pepper, turmeric and toasted gram flour. Stir thoroughly to combine all the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate for 15-20 minutes.
When you are ready to cook, wet your hands as this stops the mixture sticking to your fingers and start to shape the fish mixture into 5cm patties.  
Heat the mustard oil in a non-stick frying pan to smoking point (not required for other oils). Then remove from the heat and wait for it to cool. Once cooled start to reheat gently to cook the fish.
Fry the kebabs on medium heat for 1-2 minutes on each side until crisp and golden brown on both sides.

Fresh and fragrant lemon rice cooked with nuts and lightly toasted spices.
Hari says
A cracking South Indian dish great to eat on its own or as a side. There are so many different things you can do with rice, from cooking the rice with different ingredients as in a briyani or a pilau, or using left over rice and add some new simple flavours and textures to create an altogether new dish. This dish has a hint of lemon, which adds freshness, but I like it because of the crunch of the nuts and the vibrant colour. This is a wonderful dish to have in the sunshine as a rice salad that not only tastes great, but it looks like summer in a bowl!

Ingredients
4 tbsp vegetable oil or 2tbsp coconut oil
1 tsp mustard seeds
7-10 curry leaves
3 green chillies
1 tsp salt
½ tsp turmeric
2 tbsp peanuts or cashew nuts
2 lemons
200g Tilda Basmati rice

Method
Wash the rice until the water runs clear.
In a wide based pan add the washed rice, pour in 500ml of water (twice the amount of water to rice). Bring the water to a rolling boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and place the lid on the pan. Leave to cook for 12 minutes.
Remove from the heat, very gently fork through it and leave to cool.
In a separate pan heat the oil and add the mustard seeds. As they begin to splutter add the peanuts or cashews and fry to a golden brown colour. Add the turmeric powder, the curry leaves, green chillies and salt - fry for a minute.
Remove from the heat and stir into the rice.
Squeeze in the juice from the lemon and mix through carefully until all the rice is beautifully bright yellow.

This is such a delicious rice dish that it can be savoured as a lovely side dish to comliment a lovely tomato based dish but quite often I like to have this on its own as a meal in itself. Makes for a great take to work lunch dish!

1 tbsp corn flour
lemon juice
oil for frying
Coating
vermicelli, crushed
2-3tbsp plain flour
water

Method
Boil the potatoes until they are cooked, then mash and set to one side.
Heat oil in a pan and add the onions, sauté until soft then add the ginger, garlic and chillies.
Add all the spices with the salt and coriander stalks and stir.
Stir in the chopped fish and cook with a squeeze of lemon juice for a few minutes until the fish is cooked through.
Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool for a while before adding the mashed potatoes with the cornflour and mix together.
Check the seasoning and adjust if required.
Wet your hands and make about 10 large or 20 smaller patties out of the mixture and refrigerate.
In a separate bowl mix some flour and water to make a thick batter.
On a tray crush the vermicelli to small bits (you can also put it into a food processor to break it up).
Heat the oil in a pan ready for frying your cakes.
Take a pattie and coat in the batter on both sides. Use a fork to fish it out and get rid of any excess batter and place it on the tray with the vermicelli.
Cover the pattie with the vermicelli all over so it's completely coated and set to one side. Repeat with all the patties.
Check the oil is hot then place as many of the cakes into the pan as will fit and leave to cook for 2-3 minutes then turn them over until they are golden and crispy on both sides. Repeat with the remaining fishcakes and serve.

Crab and Prawn Cakes
A delicious south Indian dish bursting with ocean freshness and oozing curry aromatics.
Hari says
I love a fish cake and this is essentially just that but a tiny bit more posh. The blend of crab and prawn gives these little cakes a warming sweetness and the chilli bite with lemon zing balances all the deliciousness out perfectly.

I like to make fish cakes with the kids too because they can get their hands in and really experience cooking how it should be which is all about getting messy and having fun.

These cakes would traditionally be cooked in a banana leaf so if you can get hold of one just wipe it clean and wrap up the cakes individually and place it in a frying pan to cook for 5 minutes.

I like to serve these up with lots of fresh flavours so something like my mango kachumber is perfect on the side as a fresh light lunch. But if you are really hungry try them all wrapped up in a naan (or some pitta) with my spiced tomato chutney, some fresh green salad leaves and even some spiced wedges - yummy!

Ingredients
200g prawns
200g crab meat
1 large potato, cooked until just soft & grated
4 curry leaves, chopped
handful of fresh coriander leaves
mustard oil for frying
1 tsp turmeric
1 fresh chilli, finely chopped
½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tsp garam masala
½ tsp salt or to taste
juice from 1 lemon
3 tbsp gram flour
1 tsp chilli flakes

Method
Wash and roughly chop the prawns
Mix these with the crab meat, cooked potato, curry leaves, garam masala, chopped chilli, coriander leaves, Kashmiri chilli and turmeric powder, lemon juice and salt.
Wet your hands and form the mixture into 12 equal sized patties or tikki. If the mixture feels too wet you can add more cooked potato or some toasted gram flour.
Heat oil in a frying pan.
Place the gram flour onto a plate and sprinkle in a teaspoon of chilli flakes. Dust each one with the flour.
Once the oil is hot place the cakes into the pan and cook through for 3 minutes, reduce the heat if required, then turn over and cook the other side. They should be crisp on the outside - they are delicate and can break up so be gentle with them.

Prawn Pakora
King prawns tossed in a spiced masala, coated with a gram flour batter and deep fried
Hari says
Prawn pakora has a definite ring to it don't you think? And why wouldn't it - sweet king prawns marinated in muddled ginger, garlic, chilli and lemon juice. Once all the flavours infuse into the prawns they are dipped into a fragrant batter made with gram flour, cumin and coriander seeds and fried in hot oil. Simple yet delicious and great dunked into a chutney and shared with friends.

To get the main ingredients for my Pakora recipe, check our my curry kit here.

Ingredients
2 green chillies
3 garlic cloves, peeled
3cm piece ginger, peeled
juice from 1 lemon
350g raw king prawns
150g gram flour
½ tsp sea salt
½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
½ tsp ground turmeric
½ tsp cumin seeds
½ tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp garam masala
small handful coriander, finely chopped
approx. 100ml warm water
Vegetable oil, for deep-frying

Method
In a blender blitz ginger, garlic, chillies and empty into a bowl.
Add the salt, turmeric, chilli powder and lemon juice and stir through the prawns – leave these to marinate for 30 minutes.
Heat oil in a karahi for deep frying
In a second bowl, sift in the gram flour and add the crushed coriander seeds, garam masala and cumin seeds.
Add the prawn mixture and mix to coat with the batter. If it feels dry add in a little water to create a thick batter.
Check the oil is hot enough by dropping in a little batter. If it rises straight away, it's ready.
Very carefully slip a few of the prawns into the hot oil to fry for three to four minutes. Turn them over and when they're golden brown all over remove them with a slotted spoon.
Drain on a baking tray lined with kitchen paper and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining. Serve immediately while they're still hot.

Tamarind Rice
A wonderful South Indian rice dish often given to pilgrims at Hindu temples.
Hari says
There are so many ways to jazz up rice dishes and this is a great way to add a bit of a zing. Tamarind rice or 'Puliyodharai' in Tamil is a traditional South Indian dish.

It is really common with cooking from this region to use raw lentils in the tempering or tharka stage. Traditionally this dish would be cooked with a spice paste made from dry frying the lentils, fenugreek and chillies and then a second batch of the same ingredients would also be tempered in hot oil. I have simplified this recipe to include only one of these stages.

If you do not have the lentils don't worry you can make this dish without them. The strength of the tamarind used can vary so do use more if you want to increase the sourness.

Ingredients
200g Tilda Basmati Rice, cooked
25g tamarind hydrated in 100ml water or 1 tbsp tamarind paste mixed with 4 tbsp water 
2 tbsp coconut oil
1 tsp mustard seeds
½ tbsp urid dhal
1 tbsp chana dhal
½ tsp fenugreek seeds
2 dried red chillies, broken
5 curry leaves
1 onion, chopped or ½ tsp asafoetida/asafetida
1 tbsp peanuts
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt or to taste
Handful of fresh coriander

Method
Have your cooked rice ready and make up your tamarind water and set to one side.
Heat the oil in a pan and add the mustard seeds as they begin to pop stir in the urid and chana dhal. The dhal will begin to toast.
When they change colour add the fenugreek seeds, dried red chillies then stir in the curry leaves .
Add the onions (if using) and cook until they are a lovely golden brown colour or add the asafoetida and stir.
Add the peanuts to toast for a few minutes and sprinkle in the turmeric.
Pour in the tamarind. If using tamarind water leave it to cook until it has thickened (about 5 minutes).
Add salt to taste and stir in the cooked rice to coat and heat through.
Remove from the heat and sprinkle in some fresh coriander to serve.

Yoghurt Rice
Hari says
You know those dishes you are sometimes told about that you immediately think that's too simple to be special? And then you try it and, boom you are just blown away. Well, this is one of those, it sounds too simple and uninspiring to be special, it's just a mixture of rice and yoghurt I hear you say, but sometimes it's the simple things that have the most impact. 

In India this is a dish that is given to people when they are not feeling well, it's easy to digest and easy to manage. I have found that it works really beautifully with spiced fish as a side too. Let me know what you think guys!

Ingredients
1 cup cooked rice 
3 tbsp yoghurt
1 tbsp mustard oil
2 shallots, finely sliced
Temper
1 tbsp mustard oil
¼ tsp asafoetida
2 dry red chilli
15 curry leaves 

Method
Cook and cool some rice (see Plain Basmati Rice)
Heat the oil in a pan and stir in the chopped shallots, cook on a gentle heat for about five minutes to soften them. Try not to let them colour. Leave to cool.
Once cooled stir in the Greek yoghurt and the cooked shallots.
Temper
Heat mustard oil in a pan and add the asafoetida, curry leaves, dried chillies and salt. Roast for a few seconds then pour over the rice.
Stir the tempering through the rice and serve.

Simple, plain yet fragrant boiled basmati rice.
Hari says
In Indian cooking, basmati rice is a long grain rice known for its delicate fragrance and this dish is probably the one I get asked about most. Now, one thing you need to understand is that Indians are terrible rice snobs. I did try to open up my mum's world once by cooking her a risotto and I have never been looked at with such dismay - it was like her brain could not compute that you can cook rice like this, or serve someone 'rice soup' as she called it. Oh well, I tried... 

Right then, I always use basmati rice as it is the best and it always delivers. Put it like this, once you've made my rice you will never make it any other way again (or you'll have me to answer to!).

Ingredients
1 mug of washed basmati rice
2 mugs of cold water

Method
Wash the rice till the water runs clear - this is done by putting the rice in a pan stirring and draining, repeat and wash again until the water is clear. You will need to do this a few times. I always measure my rice in a mug (a standard mug will feed 3-4 people) and you will need twice the amount of water to rice to cook them perfectly.
Put your washed rice in a wide based pan and add twice the amount of cold water.
Begin to heat up the pan and bring it to a rolling boiling. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting possible and put the lid on the pan. Leave to cook for exactly 12 minutes. However tempted you maybe do not remove the lid.
After 12 minutes remove from the heat, take the lid off and leave for a few minutes.
All the water will have been absorbed and each grain will be separate - using a fork gently fluff up the rice don't just plunge straight in with a spoon

Served with
Rice is the main staple in India and as an Indian we can pretty much have this from breakfast lunch or dinner, with any dish, with any sauce and with any chutney!

Fish dish cooked in a fresh coriander and chilli masala paste and flavoured with fenugreek and coriander seeds.
Hari says
This is a lovely way to cook fish and really get some wonderful Indian flavours working. The aromatics are subtle enough to still enjoy the fish. And the masala paste is fresh and fragrant made with green coriander leaves (and stalks) to product a unique paste. 

Even trough there are some powerful spices at play the combination with the freshness of the masala paste works really well.

For this dish, I like to use thick, meaty chunks of white fish, which are marinated in turmeric. I like to finish this off with a good squeeze of lemon. 

Ingredients
Marinade
4-6 pieces of white fish, washed and dried
1 tbsp turmeric powder
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp oil
Masala Paste
large handful of coriander with stalks, washed
6 garlic cloves
1 or 2 green chillis
1 tbsp fenugreek seeds
1 tbsp coriander seeds
2 tomatoes, finely chopped
Garnish
1 tbsp garam masala
1 lemon

Method
Marinade
Sprinkle the fish with salt and turmeric powder and leave to marinade for 15 minutes.
Masala Paste
In a blender grind the fresh coriander, garlic and green chillies to create a fragrant paste.
Heat oil and shallow fry the marinated fish pieces, drain on kitchen paper and set to one side.
While heating the oil in a pan, crush the fenugreek and coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar then add the powder to the pan for a few seconds until fragrant.
Mix the masala paste into the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes.
Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5-10 minutes until the tomatoes break down.
Stir in a cup water and bring the sauce to the boil, then reduce the heat and place the fried fish slices into the sauce. Coat the fish and cook for 5 minutes until the fish is cooked through.
Garnish
Check the seasoning and sprinkle with garam masala and a good squeeze of lemon then serve hot with rice.

Indian Duck Breast with Tamarind Jam
Beautiful pan fried duck breast served with a thick tangy tamarind jam
Hari says
This is one of my all time favourite dishes and even though I know it's not typically Indian it's a dish that is very special to me. I created this for my very first pop up menu which took place at a local French restaurant for a Indo-French fusion evening and it went down an absolute storm. 

This dish represents the French influence on Indian food in the Pondicherry region of south east India. The French colonised this region in 1607 until 1954. Over the 300 years of French rule this area gave rise to a special Creole community of Franco-Indian people. This community still remains in Pondicherry as does the French influence on the architecture as well as the cuisine. 

I do think food history is facinating but before I ramble on you need to get your self some lovely duck breasts and give this dish a go.

Ingredients
Tamarind Jam
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
1 onion, sliced
2 cloves of garlic
1 tbsp ginger, grated
1 fresh tomato, chopped
½ tsp turmeric
½ salt
½ chilli, finely sliced
½ tsp kashmiri chilli powder or paprika
1 tbsp tamarind paste  
1 tsp garam masala
2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped
Duck Breasts
4 duck breasts
salt and pepper to taste
½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
2 star anise

Method
Tamarind Jam
Heat oil and fry the onion and garlic gently until they caramelise and turn a dark brown, this will take about 10-15 minutes.
Reduce the heat, add tomatoes, ginger, turmeric, salt, chopped chilli, chilli powder and cook down until the tomatoes and onions melt down to create a thick pulp.
Add the tamarind and a splash of water. Leave to cook down to create a chutney texture on a gentle heat – add a little more water if required. 
Once thick remove from the heat and add the garam masala. You can set this to once side and reheat to serve. 
Duck Breast
Heat oven to 200ºc and score the duck breast on the skin side, diagonally being careful not to go down to the flesh. Trim the edges of any excess skin.
Season the breasts on both sides with some salt, pepper, Kashmiri Chilli powder and place into a cold pan skin side down. Put the heat on a gentle flame and heat to render down the fat.
As it begins to cook add the star anise to the pan.
As the fat begins to reder out the skin, pour it out into a jar (keep this in the fridge to cook your roasties). Leave to render until the skin is a golden brown and crisp. Turn the breast so it's skin side up and cook for another 5 minutes in the pan.
Keeping it skin side up place the breast onto a baking sheet and cook for 5-6 minutes in the oven (longer if you prefer it cooked through).
Remove from the oven and leave it to rest for 5-10 minutes so the meat can relax. The duck will be cooked through yet be beautifully pink inside.
Serve with the tamarind jam.

Warming spiced minced lamb, flavoured with cumin and fenugreek, then baked in the oven.
Hari says
Lamb kebabs are the first thing that my daughter learned to cook all by herself at 5 years old, they are still her favourite, both to cook and to eat because they are quick and easy - just throw everything into a bowl and mix! Traditionally cooked on skewers in the tandoor oven this is my very quick version to cook at home. Packed full of flavour they will always get gobbled up and that is a guarantee! This kebab is so versatile that you can have it as a starter, as a quick easy snack, it's even great to cook on the BBQ and makes a really tasty alternative to humble sausage. What are you waiting for?

Ingredients
500g minced lamb
1 medium onion, very finely diced
4 cloves garlic, very finely chopped
1 tbsp ginger, grated
1 tsp salt
1 green chilli, finely chopped
½ tsp red chilli powder (optional)
2 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp of dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi)
Handful coriander, finely chopped
1 tsp oil in a small dish

Method
Heat the grill and line the grill pan with foil and place a wire rack on top.
Place the lamb mince in a large bowl and add all the other ingredients and mix together using your hands to ensure all the spices are evenly distributed.
Wash hands and rub them with a little oil. This helps to shape the kebabs and stops the mixture sticking to your hands.
Take a small amount of the mixture and mold into small sausage shapes about 10cm long and 3cm thick. Don't make them too thin. Repeat with the rest of the meat keeping the kebabs the same size smoothing out any cracks.
Place the kebabs on the rack and place under the grill and cook for 15 minutes. Turn the kebabs over so they brown evenly and leave to cook for a further 10-15 minutes.

Served with
As a starter serve with some crisp salad leaves and some thinly sliced onions with a side of tangy mint chutney. As a snack stuff some warmed pitta with salad, mint chutney, a dollop of yoghurt and a hot spicy lamb kebab.

Tandoori Sabjee
Marinated paneer, broccoli, peppers and red onion in a fragrant yoghurt marinade roasted in the oven.
Hari says
The classic tandoori marinade is so versatile - in fact, I'm not sure I have found anything it doesn't work with. I do have to make little adjustments to dishes but all in all, it's a fabulous all rounder. Yes, I agree that a tandoori dish works even better if you have a tandoor oven but very few of us have the luxury of cooking in such an amazing apparatus so cooking this dish in the oven or on the barbeque is just perfect.

You can use some other vegetables too such as potatoes, cauliflower, butternut squash but my favourites are broccoli, red onion, paneer and peppers.

To buy the main ingredients for my Tandoori, check out my curry kit here.

Ingredients
400g paneer, cut into 4 thick slices
4 large broccoli florets
1 red pepper, chopped in chunks
1 green pepper, chopped in chunks
1 red onion, chopped in chunks
Marinade
1 tbsp mustard oil
1 large lemon, juice
4 cloves garlic, crushed
5cm piece of ginger, grated
1 green chilli, finely chopped
200g Greek yoghurt
1 tsp salt
2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tbsp kashmiri red chilli powder
1 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves
Garnish
Handful of coriander chopped
2-3 lemon wedges

Method
Blend the garlic, ginger, chilli in a pestle and mortar
Place all the blended ingredients into a bowl and pour in the mustard oil and lemon juice.
Add the remaining ingredients into the bowl and mix to create a fragrant thick paste.
Add the paneer and vegetables to the paste and coat all the ingredients. Cover and leave to marinade for at least 30 minutes (the longer the better).
Heat the oven to 180oC.
Transfer to an oven tray and cook for about 10-15 minutes. Alternatively, skewer and cook on the barbeque!

Dry, hot chicken wings cooked in a Indian wok or karahi until crispy, then finished with more fiery spices.
Hari says
Chicken wings can sometimes be a little tricky to cook as they can stick to the karahi. So you'll need to be patient and leave them until they come away easily, all nice and crisp. Just before you serve them, sprinkle each with chilli and garam masala for a fiery finish. Serve with cold beers (ideally) and more than a few napkins.

Ingredients
600g chicken wings
1 tsp vegetable oil
1 tsp salt
1 red chilli, finely chopped
1 tsp hot chilli powder
1 tsp chilli flakes
1 tsp garam masala
Juice from 1 lemon
Handful fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Using some kitchen roll wipe the inside of a wok or karahi with a teaspoon of oil.  
Place the wings into the pan and begin to cook on a high heat for 15 minutes.
Turn the wings and leave to cook for a further 15 minutes.
They may stick to the pan so just leave them and they will come away once cooked. The wings will start to become crisp.
Continue to cook for a further 15-20 minutes or so until they go a golden brown and crisp up.
Check they are cooked through then remove from the karahi and discard the fat.
Place into a large bowl and while they are still hot sprinkle with salt, chopped chilli, chilli powder, chilli flakes, garam masala, fresh coriander, and a good squeeze of lemon. Toss or stir to coat them all in the spices. Serve with a crisp salad and a cooling yoghurt dip.

I always serve these with a fresh onion salad squeezed with lemon juice a little salt and fresh coriander.

Usually chicken skin is a bit of a no, no with indian cooking but I do like a crispy chicken wing so for these I tend to leave the skin on. When cooking wings in this way make sure you do it gently, this will ensure that all the fat is rendered out. The fat then needs to be poured away to get them really nice and crisp. 

Cumin is the most frequently used spice in Indian cuisine and when used whole it gives a musky aromatic that has a nutty texture. I think this dish makes a tasty little starter or a lovely bit of finger food to share with your pals.

Ingredients
600g chicken wings,
3 tbsp oil
3 tbsp cumin seeds
2 tsp garlic, crushed
2 tsp ginger, grated
1 tsp salt,
1 green chilli, finely sliced,
1 tsp chilli powder
juice from 1 lemon
handful of fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Heat oil in a large non stick pan and add cumin seeds.
Once aromatic reduce the heat.
Add the ginger and garlic then fry until golden brown.
Add the salt, green chilli and after a minute add the washed dried wings and stir fry for a couple of minutes.
Once the chicken is coated with the spices then cover the pan and leave to steam for 30 minutes.
Pour away the excess oil from the pan, and add the chilli powder and stir fry the cooked chicken to crisp up for a further few minutes.
Garnish with fresh coriander, squeeze of lemon and serve.

Crispy Hot Wings
Hari says
We all love crispy, spicy little chicken wings and these are so easy to throw together you will never need to get a KFC bucket ever again. Lightly dusted with flour and some spicy flavourings these wings can either be baked in the oven if you are feeling healthy or deep fried for extra crispiness. Enjoy!

Ingredients
3 tbsp plain flour
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
2½ tsp garlic salt
1 tsp chilli powder, or to taste
1 tsp black pepper
½ tsp salt
1 tbsp butter
12 chicken wings (skin on)
1 tsp chilli flakes

Method
Prep the wings by removing the tip and cutting at the joint. Leave the skin on.
Mix all the spices with the flour in a bowl and coat the wings really well. Shake and set to one side.
To Cook 
To bake: Preheat oven to 200ºC. Line a baking tray with foil and spread it with the butter. Place the wings on top of the butter and cook for about 15 minutes. Turn them over and cook for another 10 minutes or until crisp and cooked through.
To fry: Heat your oil to 180ºC. Fry the chicken until it's crisp and cooked through - about 7-10 minutes.
Sprinkle with chilli flakes to serve.

Hot Sticky Wings
Crispy hot wings cooked in a sticky sauce
Hari says
Everyone loves a well cooked chicken wing and I think these are pretty good. I dust them in flour and chilli and fry them first to get them nice and crisp. The sticky hot sauce is made up and smothered all over the wings and they are finished in the oven. This final baked makes them perfectly sticky so you can enjoy the crisp wings with soft succulent meat and a sauce that's well nice!

Ingredients
Wings
vegetable oil for frying
4 tbsp plain flour
1 tbsp corn flour
3 tsp chilli powder
1 tsp cumin seeds
24 wings, (split at the joints, tips removed)
Sticky sauce
3 tbsp tomato ketchup
3 tbsp brown sauce
2 tbsp hot chilli sauce or 2 red chillies chopped
2 tbsp honey
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp kalongi seeds

Method
Mix the flour and chilli in a shallow dish.
Coat the wings in the flour mixture to coat, shake off any excess.
Fry the wings in hot oil at 180ºC in batches, turning as needed, until cooked through and deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. Once cooked remove and transfer to some kitchen paper to drain.
Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180ºC
Then in a small pan combine the ketchup, chilli sauce, honey, soy and kalongi seeds and heat over medium heat for about 10 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
Pour some of the sauce into a dipping bowl for later.
Place the cooked wings onto an oven tray and pour the remaining sauce over them. Place them in the oven for about 10 minutes to crisp up and go sticky.
Serve with the sauce and some napkins.

Indo-Chinese Ribs
Hari says
Indians love Chinese food in a big way and surprisingly most restaurants you go to in India will have an Indo-Chinese selection of dishes.
Apparently it all started when some Hakka Chinese migrated to KolKata (used to be Calcutta) to work at the Tanneries in the late 19th century. This region soon developed into India's only China town and the food soon caught on too. Us Indians like to add our own delectable spices which eventually transformed the dishes into a new type of cuisine.
The food tends to use Indian ingredients and is spiced with cumin, coriander, turmeric, ginger, garlic as well as soy sauce and uses Chinese cooking techniques. There are some classic Indo-Chinese dishes such as Hakka noodles, manchurian, chilli chicken so why not ribs? These are my very sticky, very Chinese and very Indian ribs - cooked low and slow with an amazing spiced glaze. Just make sure you have your finger bowls ready!

Ingredients
2 racks of pork ribs, trimmed
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
2 tbsp Chinese five-spice

The glaze
3 star anise
3 red onions
2 cloves of garlic
3 cm piece of ginger, grated
1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
3 tbsp water or apple juice
3 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp honey
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
1 tbsp vinegar

To finish
2 spring onions
2 fresh chillies

Method
Heat the oven to 160°C.
Using a knife scrape the underside of the ribs on one end and you will see there is a transparent membrane present. Pull this membrane (use a cloth for grip) from the back of the ribs to remove it.
Place the ribs in an oven tray and rub them with five-spice, salt and pepper, drizzle with the oil and cover the tray with foil.
Place these into the oven for 3 hours, or until just tender and cooked through.

The Glaze 
For the glaze, peel and slice the onions and put them into a frying pan on a medium heat with a glug of oil and the star anise.
After a few minutes add the garlic. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until the onion softens and starts to caramelise.
Stir in the remaining glaze ingredients and leave to cook down for about 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave to cool a little.
Remove the star anise and blitz the mixture in a blender until smooth. Add a little water water if required. Check seasonaing and adjust if required.
Slice the spring onions and chillies and set to one side.
After 3 hours remove the foil from the tray and turn the oven up to 200°C.
Brush the glaze over the ribs and return them to the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, repeat this every few minutes, to get a lovely sticky glaze.

To Finish
Sprinkle with the chopped chillies and spring onions and serve the ribs with any leftover glaze for dipping.

Hot and Spicy BBQ Ribs
The best hot and spicy barbecue ribs!
Hari says
I could eat ribs all day long, the soft, fall off the bone meat, smothered in a hot and spicy sauce is what happy eating is all about. Now this is a hot dish but remember you can reduce the chillies to suit you or miss them out completely if you want to do this for the kids.
I know there are many, many rib recipes out there so I wanted to throw mine into the ring too. I love it and I want you guys to love it too. So throw in all the ingredients and enjoy the long slow cooking - You can thank me later!

Ingredients
2 racks of ribs

Dry Rub
3 tbsp fennel seeds
1 tsp peppercorns
2 tbsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp heaped smoked paprika
1 tsp salt 

Wet Glaze
2 tbsp tomato ketchup
2 tbsp brown sauce
2 tbsp honey
1 tbsp hot chilli sauce or 4 hot birds eye chillies, minced
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tbsp soy sauce

Method
Heat your oven to 140ºC.
Using a knife scrape the underside of the ribs on one end and you will see there is a transparent membrane present. Pull this membrane (use a cloth for grip) from the back of the ribs to remove it. Remove any excess fat too.

Dry Rub
In a pestle and mortar bash up the fennel, cumin and pepper and put into a bowl then stir in the paprika and salt.
Place the ribs on an oven tray and rub the dry spices all over the ribs. Cover with foil and cook in the oven for 3-4 hours.

Wet Glaze
Meanwhile, make up the glaze and when the ribs are ready smear half the marinade over the ribs on both sides.
Increase the temperature of the oven to 200ºC and return the ribs to the oven for 10 minutes.
Every few minutes spoon over a little more of the glaze and replace in the oven for a final 20 minutes until the ribs are sticky and delicious.

Tamarind Ribs
Sticky, tangy, spicy blackened tamarind ribs - need I say more?
Hari says
A firm Friday night favourite in my house. I keep these ribs for the grown ups because it feels like tamarind sticky ribs is something to indulge in when the kids have gone to bed. This is food that gets all the senses going so ditch the knife and fork pull out the napkins and enjoy the fruity tang, the sticky sweetness, the chilli heat and the altogether loveliness that is this dish.

Ingredients
100g tamarind pulp
650ml boiling water
8 cloves garlic, minced
4cm piece of ginger, grated
2 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
2 star anise
2 chillies, finely chopped
100ml soy sauce
100g brown sugar
2 whole rack of pork ribs

Method
Place the tamarind pulp in a bowl, and add the boiling water. Let it soak for 15 minutes then mash it up using a fork. Sieve the tamarind water into a bowl and discard all the solids.
Into a roasting tray big enough to hold the ribs pour in the tamarind liquid, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, crushed coriander, star anise, chopped chillies and brown sugar. Stir until all the sugar dissolves.
Using a knife scrape the underside of the ribs on one end and you will see there is a transparent membrane present. Pull this membrane (use a cloth for grip) from the back of the ribs to remove it. Then place the ribs in the roasting tray and coat with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for as long as possible - overnight is best.
Preheat the oven to 160ºC and cover the tray tightly with foil.
Cook the ribs until the meat starts to pull away easily from bones (about 2-3 hours).
Remove the tray from the oven and increase the heat to 180ºC.
Pour the juices from the tray into a saucepan, skim off any excess fat and boil the juices over a medium heat for about 15 minutes until it reduces and thickens. Pour half into a small bowl as a dipping sauce for later.
Brush the remaining sauce over the ribs and place back in the hot oven until the ribs are black and bubbling (about 5 minutes).
Brush with any remaining tamarind sauce and leave for a few minutes before cutting into single rib portions.
Serve with the dipping sauce.

Chicken Chaat
Tangy, tamarind flavoured shredded chicken.
Hari says
Chaat is a savoury snack - and Indians love a savoury snack. And this is why Indian food has blended so well with the British culture, as we love them too. Chaat is usually served at the roadside in India and is either vegetable or meat based, served with hot dry spices, sour tamarind sauce, fresh yoghurt and green coriander. There are so many different versions to play with, but they are all about awakening your taste buds with sharp, yet delicious, flavours.

Ingredients
4 chicken thighs, skinned and trimmed
3 cloves garlic
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, finely diced
2 green chillies, finely chopped
2-4 tbsp tamarind water, or juice from 1 lemon
1 tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp mango powder (amchoor)
Handful of fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Place chicken in a pan and cover with water, add the garlic cloves, salt and place on a gentle heat.
Cook for about 10 minutes and remove from the water and leave to cool. Retain the water as stock.
Heat the oil in a pan and add the onions, cook gently until browned.
Add the green chilli, salt to taste and pour in the tamarind water with a little of the stock water from the chicken.
Cook gently and let the sauce reduce. Add a little more stock and cook to thicken. After about 5 minutes add both the chilli and mango powders.
Once the chicken has cooled, shred it using two forks and add to the sauce.
Stir to coat and leave to cook for a few minutes.
Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the garam masala and a handful of fresh coriander.

I like to serve this with salad, finely sliced onion rings, sliced green chillies and some yoghurt.

Lamb Pitta Toastie
Crispy pitta breads oozing with a spiced meaty filling
Hari says
A delicious spiced lamb pitta toastie that makes a great lunch time dish when served up with a fresh crisp salad and some mango kachumber. This has to be one of my favourite sandwich fillings.

I made this instead of making some kebabs one day by just spicing the mince and smeared it inside some pitta breads and cooked it on a griddle pan. This toasts the pitta and the juices from the meat and spices seep through making the whole thing irresistible. 

Ingredients
400g minced lamb,
1 medium onion, very finely diced
1 tsp salt
twist of black pepper
1 chilli, finely chopped
½ tsp red chilli powder (optional)
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
2 tsp garam masala
Handful coriander, finely chopped
4 pitta breads
8 slices of chedder cheese

Method
Using a fork, mix lamb, onion, coriander, cumin, salt, pepper, in a large bowl. Cover and chill for about 20 minutes.
Prepare the griddle pan by smearing on a little oil with some kitchen roll. Then begin to heat to a medium heat.
Open each pitta pocket by cutting along one side.
With a spoon fill each pitta with the spiced lamb. Make sure you spread it right to the edges. Press the pitta closing it up.
Grill the pitta breads until the filling is cooked through and bread is crisp, about 5 minutes per side.

A lovely flavoured hot sauce made with two types of red chilli.
Hari says
A wonderfully vibrant red chilli sauce made with roasted habaneros, red birds eye chillies and garlic. This sauce has a slightly sweet roasted flavour but be warned it is hot. A great one to show off to your friends. 

Top tip:
Coat your hands in a little oil and then wash them with soap to make sure you get rid of all unwanted chilliness from your fingers!

Ingredients
150g habanero chillies
50g red birds eye chillies (or for a milder sauce jalapenos)
1 large onion, sliced
1 garlic bulb
1 tsp salt (to taste)
60ml vinegar

Method
Put kitchen gloves on and remove the stalks from the chillies.
Place on an oven tray with the whole bulb of garlic. Heat the oven to 180°C and roast for 15-20 minutes.
Peel the garlic cloves and place into a pan with the chillies.
Add the remaining ingredients to the pan and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.
Pour into a liquidiser and blend to a fine puree. If you want the sauce to be a thick sauce then leave it as it is but for a thinner sauce sieve. Store in a sealed jar - this will keep for three weeks in the fridge.

Earthy cumin potatoes with a zingy finish.
Hari says
This is a really delicious way to spice up your potato side dish. It's a bit different to the usual Bombay Potatoes, this one is filled with earthy flavours of cumin but the tangy zing of the amchoor is just heavenly (you can use a little lemon juice if you don't have amchoor).

These potatoes with plain fried Indian bread (parantha) and some yoghurt reminds me of the kind of food I grew up, on really homely but full of flavour. I really hope you like it.

Ingredients
4 potatoes, boiled and cubed
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp coriander seeds
2 tsp cumin seeds
2 green chillies, slit lengthways
3cm fresh ginger, sliced very thinly
1 tsp red chilli powder
¼ tsp turmeric powder
salt to taste
2 tsp mango powder (amchoor powder)
handful of coriander leaves, chopped

Method
Boil the potatoes gently with the skin on for about 10 minutes. Once cooled peel and cut them into 4cm cubes and set to one side.
Dry roast the coriander seeds and 1 tsp of cumin seeds until fragrant then remove from the heat and cool before crushing.
Heat oil and add remaining cumin seeds once sizzling and fragrant, stir in the sliced green chillies and sliced ginger. Saute for a few seconds, reduce the heat and then add the roasted spice powder, turmeric powder, chilli powder and salt.
Add the boiled and cubed potatoes. Mix well so that it is well coated with the seasoning.
Cook on a gentle heat for 10 minutes stirring occasionally - you don't want them to turn into mash.
Add the amchoor powder and garnish with coriander leaves.

Spicy Lemon Roasted Potatoes
Crispy new potatoes with a zingy finish
Hari says
Indian roast new potatoes with a citrus zing and the earthiness of fenugreek all cooked with a touch of asafoetida to balance the bitter flavour of the fenugreek.

The armchoor gives a fruity tang to these crispy potatoes and makes this a fun side dish. The potaotes work beautifully with a roast chicken dinner for a unique twist or with some spiced fish as a healthy summer supper.

Ingredients
1kg new potatoes, washed
4 tbsp rapeseed oil
¼ tsp asafoteda
½ tsp turmeric
1 tbsp coriander, seeds, crushed
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
½ tsp chilli powder

Remove from the heat and dust with the armchoor and squeeze in the juice from one lemon before serving.

Tandoori Style Pigeon Breast
Pigeon breast beautifully spiced in a tandoori style marinade
Hari says
I think this is a really lovely way to cook pigeon especially if you are worried that pigeon may be too strong and gamey for you. The spices combine beautifully with the flavour of the meat to lift it making this a really special dish.

In terms of the marinade, it isn't a traditional tandoori marinade. We are creating here it's more of a 'tandoori style' flavour which works with this meat. I like to pan fry the breasts first to get a wonderful colour and aroma and then I smear over the second marinade and cook them in the oven. Remember with pigeon you don't want to over cook it so keep an eye on it, especially if like me, you prefer it slightly more on the pink side. And secondly - let it rest for at least 5-6 minutes before you dive in.

To buy the main ingredients for my Tandoori, check out my curry kit here.

Ingredients
8 pigeon breasts
First Marinade
4 cloves garlic
3 cm piece of ginger
1 tsp of salt
½ tsp chilli powder
juice from 1 lemon
Yoghurt Marinade
100ml thick Greek yoghurt
1 tsp kashmiri red chilli powder
1 tsp of garam masala
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed

Method
First Marinade
Blend the ginger, garlic to make a paste.
Mix the ginger and garlic paste with lemon juice, salt, chilli powder and coat the pigeon breasts. Leave them to marinate for about 20 minutes.
Yoghurt Marinade
Meanwhile make up a second marinade with the yoghurt, kashmiri chilli powder, garam masala and crushed cumin seeds.
Heat the oven to 180ºC
Once marinaded heat a frying pan and fry the breasts for about 1 minutes on each side.
Remove and place on an oven try then smear the yoghurt marinade over each breast. Place in the oven and cook for a further 3-4 minutes if you want the breasts pink. Longer if you prefer them more well done.
Remove from the oven and leave them to rest for at least 5 minutes.
Slice the breast and squeeze with a little lemon and serve with some salad.

Spiced Potato Stuffed Peppers
Wonderful whole pepper dish stuffed with spiced potatoes.
Hari says
I'm sure every culture has a stuffed pepper recipe and this is the Indian one. I cooked these with my mum last year when we were on holiday in the South of France. We hadn't cooked this for years in fact the last time I did this dish with my mum I'm sure I was still living at home. These green and red capsules stuffed with spiced potatoes represent summer to me so being in the sunshine in France was the perfect opportunity to break out this healthy recipe. Just be aware a whole stuffed pepper is quite filling!

It's a really versatile dish and you can change the stuffing to chickpeas or even minced lamb. It also cooks beautifully on the barbecue and gives a delicious smokiness to the peppers.

Ingredients
4 whole peppers, 2 red and 2 green
4 medium sized potatoes, boiled and diced
1 tsp rapeseed oil
1 tsp of salt
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 green chilli, finely chopped
1 tsp garam masala
3cm fresh ginger, grated
1 tbsp fenugreek leaves
1 tbsp fresh coriander, finely chopped

Method
Filling
Cook the potatoes gently with the skin on (do not boil too vigorously) for 20-25 minutes. Once soft leave to cool and then peel. Cut into small cubes and place into a large bowl.
In a small frying pan heat the oil and fry the cumin seeds. When sizzling and aromatic remove and add to the potatoes.
Next add the salt, chilli, garam masala, fenugreek, ginger and fresh coriander to the potatoes and stir - check seasoning.
Cooking the pepper
Cut the top off the peppers, keeping the stalk intact.
Remove the insides and discard.
Divide the potato mixture into four and stuff each of the peppers. Replace the top of each of the peppers.
Heat the oven to 180oC and place on a baking sheet.
Drizzle with a little oil and cook for about 30 minutes.

Served with
I find these really filling so half of one would make a lovely for a lunch with a green salad with some mint chutney on the side.

Nimbu ka Achaar (Lemon Pickle)
Hot and spicy lime pickle.
Hari says
Any Indian meal is not complete without a selection of side dishes and condiments. Lime pickle is a classic condiment that is eaten with many dishes, it not just to dip your crispy poppadoms into it is so much more.

In India this pickle is made with lemons (nimbu means lemons). This is because the lemons are much smaller in size then european ones and they have a very thin outer peel. Also the climate over there means pickles like this soften much more quickly. I have also added a quick method below which involves steaming the limes to help soften them more quickly.

There are many ways of making this pickle and sometimes I also add ginger and garlic in step one. Others also like to add the same amount of sugar to give a slight sweet and spicy flavour. Once you have this basic recip under your belt you can start to add your own twists to it.

This is a very tangy pickle because all the acidity is drawn out of the limes but it's beautifully balanced with the salt and chilli.

This is a uniquely flavoured pickle that makes a wonderful gift to give to your friends.

Print
Ingredients Method
4 limes, washed and cut into 8 chunks (skin on - remove pips)
2 tbsp salt
1 tsp turmeric
1 tbsp chilli powder (adjust to taste)
Oil tempering
3 tbsp mustard oil
1 tsp brown mustard seeds
1 tsp fenugreek seeds
1 tsp kalonji seeds (nigella)
½ tsp asafoetida
3 dried red chillies (optional)

Method
Sterilise a glass jar and add the chopped limes, salt, chilli powder and turmeric.
Put the lid on the jar and shake.
Leave the jar on a window sill (preferably in the sun) for one month. Ensure you give the jar a shake everyday.
After one month heat the mustard oil to smoking point then leave to cool.
Once cooled, reheat and add the mustard, fenugreek, kalonji seeds, asafoetida and dried chillies until they sizzle. Cool and pour the spiced oil into the jar with the limes. Shake and leave for a few days before using.
Quick version
After step 1 above squeeze the juice from the limes and set the juice to one side. Put the limes into a steamer for about 15 minutes until they are soft. Leave to cool.
Add the juice back into the limes and place in a jar and leave for 2 days. Ideally on a window sill inthe sun. Ensure you shake the jar every few hours.
Move to step 4 as above.
 


Served with
This pickle can be stored for up to a year. Ensure that no water is introduced into the pickle. This makes a tangy pickle for nibbles as well as a side for your main dishes. You can substitute the limes for lemons, green mangoes or aubergines instead.

Aloo Pakora
Hari says
Pakora is one of India's most infamous snack dishes. Usually, it involves a mixture of different vegetables all bound together with spices and gram flour. This style of pakora is a little more simple and more along the lines of a Japaneese tempura dish, but still uses gram flour. 

This was the pakora of choice for all kids when I was growing up. These golden discs of potatoes dipped into batter and fried were just amazing. The only thing that made them better (dare I say it) was smothering them in Heinz ketchup. Well, I was five! We would leave the mixed veg, spinach and chilli ones for the grown ups and feast on these.

Turning this in to a slightly more adult version, I have cut out the ketchup and added a tang with some chaat masala. Don't just take my word for it - give them a go #tasty!  

To get the main ingredients for my Pakora recipe, check our my curry kit here.

Ingredients
1 medium size potato
100g gram flour, sieved
1 tbsp rice flour
Salt as required
½ tsp carom seeds
½ cumin seeds
1 tbsp grated ginger
½ tsp red chilli powder
1 garam masala powder
Pinch of fresh coriander, chopped
? to ¾ cup water
1 tsp chaat masala powder for sprinkling on the pakoras

Method
Mix all the dry ingredients with water and check the seasoning, adjust if needed.

Peel and slice the potatoes thinly in rounds.

Heat oil for frying in a kadai or pan.

Dip each potato, slice in the batter and place it gently in hot oil - fry aloo pakoras until they are golden and crisp.

Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.

Repeat with the remaining aloo, cooking in batches. 

Sprinkle with some chaat masala powder and serve with a mint chutney.


Served with
Delicious when served as a starter or as a  nibble with imlee, which is a tamarind based chutney. My children love these with just some plain old tomato ketchup to dunk into.

A spicy filling of chunky potato and green peas with a bite of chilli encased in a crisp light pastry.
Hari says
Probably the most well known of all the Indian snacks – samosas are simply amazing and I love them. They're made of pastry, potato, peas and that's it - how three simple ingredients can taste so good is beyond me, but they are just amazing! For me this is a vegetable dish and although I have cooked meat samosas in my classes it's not something I usually do. 

There are four key stages to making samosas:

1. Making the filling

2. Making the pastry

3. Filling the samosa

4. Frying

My most significant memory of samosas is from my wedding where they were part of the festivities, right from all my aunties forming a production line in the kitchen gossiping, giggling and producing the amazing triangles parcels through to serving them for breakfast with a cup of hot, sweet chai – a combination that is out of this world. 

You can't help eating them one after the other and I think we got through hundreds of them. My best friend Nicky and her husband Mark called me a few days after the wedding and asked me if I could pop over and make a few before we left for our honeymoon as they were having withdrawal symptoms - they're so addictive!

Ingredients
Filling
1 tsp of rapeseed oil
4 potatoes boiled (skin on)
50g frozen peas
½ tsp of cumin seeds
1 tsp of salt
½ tsp chilli powder
2 chillies, finely chopped
1-2 tsp of garam masala
1 tbsp ginger, grated
2 tbsp of fresh coriander, chopped
Paste
1 tbsp plain flour in a small bowl
Splash of cold water
Pastry
200g plain flour
1½ tbsp rapeseed oil
Pinch of salt
Approx. 100ml water
Making the samosa
Potato filling
Pastry
Paste
Rapeseed oil for deep frying

Method
Filling
Cook the potatoes gently with the skin on (do not boil too vigorously) for about 25 minutes until soft. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Once cooled peel the skin off with your fingers.
Cut into small 1cm sized cubes and place in a large bowl.
In a small frying pan heat the oil and fry the cumin seeds. When sizzling, carefully add the peas and fry gently for a few minutes to soften. Remove from the heat and leave to cool before adding to the potatoes.
Add the grated ginger, salt, chilli, chilli powder, garam masala and fresh coriander to the potatoes and stir - check seasoning and refrigerate for 10 minutes.
Paste
Make some flour glue by adding water to the flour and mix into a thick sticky paste.
Pastry
Place flour, oil and salt in a bowl and rub the mixture together.
Using your hand begin to sprinkle in a little water at a time to bring the dough together.
Continue to add the water in this way until the dough comes together. Using wet hands knead the dough until it is soft and no longer sticking to your hands or the bowl.
Refrigerate for 10 minutes. Heat up a thava or frying pan on the lowest heat setting.
Take a small tangerine-sized ball of the dough and roll it between your palms to make a smooth ball.
Flatten and roll out with a rolling pin to create a thin round disc the size of a side plate, flouring when necessary. Place the disc on the tava for 4 seconds. Remove and place on a chopping board. Using a sharp knife slice the disc in half so you are left with 2 semi-circles.
Making the samosa
Place one semi-circle on your hand with the flat edge at the top and the cooked side facing you. Dip your finger in the paste and spread it across the straight edge.
Fold in the two corners so they meet in the middle ensuring one edge overlaps the other and press together to seal all the way down to create a smooth upside down cone.
Turn the cone over so the pointed end is at the bottom. Using a spoon fill the cone with the potato filling to 2/3 of the way up.
Seal the opening with the paste, creating a triangle pastry. Lie on the tray and pat down to even the filling out. Repeat with the remaining dough until all your samosa made made.
Cooking the samosa
Heat the oil, test it's hot enough by dropping in a little bit of pastry – if it bubbles and floats to the top immediately then the oil is ready.
Very carefully slip one samosa into the hot oil being careful that the hot oil doesn't splash out. Leave the samosa to cook for a few seconds. As the pastry begins to bubble turn it over using a slotted spoon.
Leave it to cook gently until it turns a beautiful golden brown. Once it's cooked remove from the oil and set on some kitchen paper. As you become more confident, fry 2 or 3 samosas at the same time.

Served with
Serve hot! My children like samosas with tomato ketchup, but for me you can only have samosas with a tangy imlee chutney made with tamarind.

Crisp golden potato and onion bites cooked with a selection of spices in a gram flour batter which are deep fried.
Hari says
I can remember my mum cooking pakora all the time. These were a staple for when guests arrived unannounced, which believe me happened a lot! They take minutes to cook and are lighter than the onion bhajis most people are used to. My son once described them as little aliens as I was scooping them out of the fryer - they are crispy and spiky and a mishmash of shapes.

I cook pakora in a number of different ways, either with onion and potato or a mixture of vegetables; onion, potato, aubergines and cauliflower. You can also make them with just slices of aubergine or potato or even whole chillies.

This is the basic pakora recipe which is a great place to start - remember to season to your taste with as much or as little spice as you like.

To get the main ingredients for my Pakora recipe, check out my pakora curry kit here.

Ingredients
100g gram flour, sieved
1 medium onion
3 medium potatoes
1 tsp of salt
2 tsp of garam masala
1 tsp of turmeric
2 chillies, finely chopped
1 tbsp ginger, grated (optional)
Handful of coriander, chopped
2 tsp of dried fenugreek leaves
1 tsp of cumin seeds
½ tsp of red chilli powder
Water
Oil for deep frying 

Method
Heat up the oil in a karahi or wok to a medium heat.
Slice the onion lengthways very thinly and place in a bowl.
Peel and grate (or very finely chop) the potatoes into the same bowl. You can also use aubergines and cauliflower - chop into very small pieces.
Sprinkle all the dry spices and freshly chopped coriander, chillies and ginger into the bowl and then sieve in the gram flour - mix together using your hands. 
Add a small amount of water a little at a time to create a thick batter that coats all the vegetables. Squeeze the mixture through your fingers to ensure all the spices mix through. Do not leave the batter and vegetable mixture for too long before cooking.
Test your oil is hot enough by dropping a little batter into the oil. If it browns and rises immediately then it is ready. Very carefully drop in spoonfuls of the mixture into the oil and fry until golden brown.
Using a slotted spoon move the pakora around, be careful not to overcrowd the karahi.
Once golden brown and crisp remove from the oil and set on some kitchen paper.

Delicious when served as a starter or a nibble with imlee which is a tamarind based chutney. My children love these with just some plain old tomato ketchup to dunk into.

Beetroot Chutney
Hari says
This is a lovely way to use beetroot. It's a simple and vibrant sauce that is super easy to make. The sweetness from the beetroot works so beautifully with the delicate cumin and warming ginger and chilli. To top that, the gorgeous colour looks simply amazing too. 

Ingredients
1 beetroot
½ tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp chana dhal
1 tsp urid dhal
8 curry leaves
3 garlic cloves
2 tsp oil
½ tsp mustard seeds
½ tsp chilli powder

Method
Peel the skin off the beetroot and chop into small cubes.
In a pan, add oil and throw in the cumin seeds, red chilli, garlic, curry leaves, channa dal and urad dal.
Saute on a gentle flame until the lentils turn a golden colour. Empty into a bowl and set to one side.
Add a little oil and add the chopped beetroot and saute gently. Be careful as it can burn very easily. Add more oil if needed.
Cook for about 10 minutes until it is soft and then allow it to cool.
Put the beetroot and the fried spice mix into a blender and grind to a fine paste.
Heat oil in a pan and add the mustard seeds. Once they splutter, remove from the heat and pour into the ground chutney. Stir and transfer to a serving bowl.

Hari says
A wonderful sweet and sour chutney that is perfect for any Indian snack.

It's simple to make and takes no time at all. The combination of tamarind, jaggery and the ginger is just wonderful. It's best to use tamarind that's in a block form for this chutney as the flavours are much for potent but if you can't find it in a block then a paste will do. I would, however, recommend that you steer away from using a Tamarind concentrate as these can be thick, gloopy and black in colour which doesn't result in the most pleasant looking chutney.

Ingredients
100g tamarind
150g jaggery grated
1 tsp Salt
1 tsp kala namak (pink salt), optional
1 tsp garam Masala
½ tsp ginger powder
½ tsp black pepper
½ tsp chilli powder

Method
If using tamarind in the block form - cover the tamarind in boiling water, leave it to soak for about 10-20minutes.
Using a fork mash it well and then strain, save the tamarind water and discard the stones and pulp. (You can repeat this process to get more tamarind water). The tamarind water should be pouring consistency.
Pour the tamarind water (or paste) into a pan, add the rest of the ingredients and bring to a boil. Leave to simmer for a few minutes until it thickens to a sauce consistency.
Cool and serve.

Pudina Lamb Cutlets
Tender lamb cutlets marinated in a delicate pepper and vinegar marinade finished with some dried mint
Hari says
I love these cutlets, they are soft, tender and the marinade is just divine. Because the cutlets come from the best end of the lamb they take no time to cook at all. The marinade is simple to make, it tenderises the meat and flavours it just beautifully. It's a great starter for a dinner party

The marinade is a simple blend of vinegar, pepper and a few spices to make the meat even more tender the meat and flavour it beautifully. I love to make this dish as a starter for dinner parties because the cutlets look really impressive on the plate when served with a vibrant chutney - I think avocado yoghurt is simply perfect.  

Ingredients
1 rack of lamb (8 cutlets)
30ml malt vinegar
3cm piece ginger
3 garlic cloves
1tsp degi chilli powder (or use half chilli powder and half paprika)
1tsp salt
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp black pepper, crushed
some dried mint

Method
Cut the rack into individual cutlets. Flatten them out a little using the back of your knife or a rolling pin.
Mince the garlic and ginger in a blender to make a paste.
Into a bowl add the vinegar, ginger and garlic paste, chilli powder, salt, oil and pepper. 
Stir and add the cutlets. Leave to marinade for about 30 minutes.
Heat up your griddle and place the marinated cutlets on to cook. After about 4 minutes turn them and cook for another 2 minutes.
Remove them from the pan and let them rest for a few minutes.
Serve with a dusting of dried mint and a blob of avocado yoghurt.

Spicy Lamb Chops
Perfectly grilled lamb chops for the summer
Hari says
These are really easy to throw together when you have some friends pop by because all you have to do is just smear them with the marinade and leave them until you are ready to cook. They are great with potato wedges and a salad so perfect for barbecue season.

If you can't get hold of the Kashmiri chillies then just mix equal amounts of paprika (for colour) and chilli powder (for the chilli hit).

Ingredients
4 lamb chops
1 tbsp coriander seeds
1 tsp fennel seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
5 dried Kashmiri chillies (or chilli powder mixed with paprika)
4 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
2 tbsp ginger, grated
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp rapeseed oil 
1 lemon

Method
In a pestle and mortar crush the coriander, cumin, fennel seeds and dried chillies.
Then add the garlic, ginger and salt then grind with the spices to create a thick paste.
Pour in the oil and lemon juice and mix together.
Smear the paste all over the chops and leave to marinate for at least 1 hour.
Ensure they are at room temperature and cook on a griddle or barbecue for 4-5 minutes on each side until cooked through.

Ginger Spiced Lemonade
Refreshing nimbu pani with a zing of ginger
Hari says
This is a wonderful take on Shrikanji or nimbu pani. Nimbu pani is a refreshing north Indian drink that is sold on every street corner as an amazing thirst quencher. This version I have added a little zing of ginger for a bit of warmth - well the summers we have here in the UK aren't anything like the ones in India so this is refreshing and soothing too.

Ingredients
150g ginger
130g sugar
1L water
juice from 8 lemons
1 tsp rock salt or black salt as required
½ tsp chaat masala
a few ice cubes

Method
To make the ginger syrup peel the ginger and chop into roughly into chunks.
Put the ginger, sugar and half the water into a pan and bring to the boil.
Reduce the heat and leave it to simmer to reduce for about 40 minutes to an hour.
Strain the syrup through a sieve and leave to cool.
Strain the lemon juice into the remaining water and add the ginger syrup.
Stir in the salt and chaat masala
Check the flavour make any adjustments and leave to chill before serving over ice.

Watermelon Saunf Sharbat
A cooling fennel infused watermelon sharbat
Hari says
What better way to cool off than with a tall glass of sharbat. This one uses the awesome watermelon as the refreshing fruit together with the cooling effects of fennel. A lovely sweet syrup is made which has the delicate fennel flavour infused into it which is then blended with the watermelon. Happy days!

Ingredients
1 tsp fennel seeds
2 tbsp sugar
150ml water
1 watermelon, chopped with seeds removed
1 tbsp lemon juice
pinch salt

Method
In a small frying pan toast the fennel seeds over medium heat, until they are fragrant - about a minute.
In a pan add the water and sugar and bring to the boil to dissolve the sugar.
Add the fennel seeds and leave to simmer until the water has reduced by half.
Remove from the heat and set to one side for a few minutes.
In a blender puree the watermelon with the fennel syrup, lemon juice, and salt.
Transfer to a jug and stir, leave to chill.
Serve the sharbat in a glass over ice.

Melon soup with a slight hint of chilli and toasted cumin
Hari says
Sometimes we all want to do something a little bit different and I think this very simple melon soup is great. It doesn't need any cooking and is perfect for a healthy summer starter. Melons have a wonderful sweetness that works beautifully with a little hint of chilli. With this recipe I have infused a little chilli heat into the melon and finished with some roasted cumin. Give it a go.

Bonda's
Hari says
These are India's answer to the potato croquet and they are simply wonderful. These little spice bombs of deliciousness contain a whole lot of South Indian flavours that taste amazing with the soft texture of the potato. From the pop of mustard seeds, and the crunch of roasted urad dhal and the warmth of curry leaves these will definitely leave you wanting more.

The outer batter is simple to make using gram flour and a few little spices. Once these are deep fried you need to eat them pretty quickly when they are still crisp and delicious. Enjoy!

Ingredients
Potato filling 
4 to 5 medium-sized potatoes
1tsp mustard seeds
1tsp urad dal (split and dehusked)
1 medium sized onion, finely chopped
2 cloves of garlic
4cm ginger
15 curry leaves, chopped
2 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped
1 or 2 green chillies, finely chopped (depending on how hot you like it)
½ tsp turmeric powder
½ tsp chilli powder
squeeze of lemon juice
salt to taste
Batter
2 cups gram flour
¼ cup rice flour
200-250ml water
¼ tsp turmeric powder
½ tsp red chilli powder
a pinch of baking soda
½ tsp salt

Method
Wash the potatoes and boil in a pan with the skin on until cooked through
Once cooled peel and grate the potatoes into a bowl
Heat the mustard oil in a frying pan, when hot add the mustard seeds and when they start to splutter, add the urad dal and cook until it turns golden brown in colour.
Add the chopped onion and sauté until it just starts to brown. Meanwhile put the ginger and garlic into a pestle and mortar and grind to a paste.
Add the crushed ginger and garlic to the onions along with the sliced curry leaves and green chillies.
Leave to cook for a minute then add the turmeric powder.
Remove from the heat and add pour into the potatoes along with the coriander leaves and chilli powder and mix it all through.
The mixture should be nice and dry then squeeze in a little lemon juice and salt. Mix and check the seasoning.
Make ping pong sized balls from this mixture and refrigerate for 10 minutes.
Make up the batter by mixing all the ingredients in a bowl. It should be nice and thick.
Start to heat oil in a small pan to deep fry the bonda's. Check it's hot enough by dropping in a little batter. If it sinks and sizzles back to the top immediately it is ready. 
Dip each potato ball into the batter, coat it well with the batter and gentle place into the hot oil.
Fry the aloo bondas until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove and set on some kitchen roll to drain.

These are delicious little spice bombs packed full of flavour that are super easy to make. I can promise you everyone will love them (unless your friends don't eat meat that is).

The children love them (just remember to leave the chilli out for them), the guys will love them especially with a cold beer and because they a little nibbles your girlfriends will love them too.

It's the type of dish that vanishes as soon as you bring it out so make sure you do enough.
I love to serve these as a pre-dinner snack with some 5 spice Indian tomato chutney or a hot and tangy Mint chutney.

Ingredients
400g mince lamb
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
½ tsp salt
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tsp chilli powder (add a little more for more of a kick)
2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp cinnamon
handful fresh coriander, finely chopped

Method
In a large mixing bowl add the mince lamb with all the other ingredients except the oil.
Mix everything together using your hands to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.
Rub a little oil on to your hands to stop the mixture sticking to your fingers.
Take a small amount of the meat and roll in your palms to make a meatball. Ensure it is smooth all over and set to one side. Repeat with the rest of the mixture.
Heat the oil in a frying pan.
Carefully fry the meatballs (kofta) in batches so they brown and crisp up all over (15-20 mins).
Remove the kofta using a slotted spoon and set them on some kitchen paper to drain.
Serve as a little snack or serve 2 or 3 as a lovely starter.

Chicken Salad with Pink Grapefruit and Cumin Dressing
Hari says
I think that every time you have a salad it has to be bright and look fresh so you know it's doing you some good and packed with healthy nutrients. This colourful Indian spiced chicken and grapefruit salad is all about the summer and is spicy, tangy and fun. It's great to use new or different ingredients with existing dishes and here I like to make a tandoori style masala marinade using pink grapefruit. The colour of the marinaded chicken looks the same as the flesh of the pink grapefruit so not only does it look beautiful against the peppery green salad leaves but it adds a zing and a totally new texture to the salad. For the dressing, the toasted cumin is really important. Just toast off a few seeds in a pan and then crush them to intensify the warming earthy aroma that is so important in this light, sunny salad.

Ingredients
4 chicken thighs, trimmed
5cm piece ginger
3 cloves of garlic
1 pink grapefruit, juice
1 tbsp oil,
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tsp garam masala
salt to taste
Dressing
1 tbsp olive oil,
1 tsp roasted cumin seeds,
1 tsp honey
½ pink grapefruit 
Salad
large pinch coriander leaves, chopped
large pinch of mint leaves, chopped
Handful of baby spinach
Handful of rocket
Handful of watercress 
½ pink grapefruit

Method
Heat the oven to 180ºC.
Cut the chicken into chunks and set to one side.
Crush the ginger and garlic in a pestle and mortar and place in a bowl.
Squeeze in the juice from the grapefruit and pour in the oil, chilli powder, garam masala and salt.
Mix the chicken to marinade for a few minutes then place onto a baking sheet and cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes until cooked through.
Meanwhile, mix the dressing ingredients with juice from half the grapefruit in a jam jar and shake to mix.
With the other half of the grapefruit slice out the segments. 
Once the chicken is cooked leave to cool.
Put the salad leaves into a bowl and dress with the dressing then place the pieces of chicken onto the salad with the segments of grapefruit. 
Sprinkle over the mint and coriander and serve.

Nimbu Pani
A refreshing Indian lemonade
Hari says
Shrikanji or nimbu pani is a sure fire sign that summer is here. In the northern states of India it is sold on every street corner as an incredible thirst quencher but more importantly, it also replenishes salts and gives that sugar boost that is needed in soring temperatures. Even more importantly, it tastes amazing and it takes minutes to make. In India the lemons are smaller and they look like limes so either will do for this recipe, if you can't get hold of chaat masala or black salt then just miss it out. It's really important that you taste this because it is about personal taste, you may like this slightly sweeter so just adjust according to your tastes.

Ingredients
2 lemons or 3 limes
2 glasses of water
1 tsp cumin powder
1 tsp rock salt or black salt as required
1 tbsp sugar (may need to add more) 
½ tsp chaat masala
4-5 mint leaves
a few ice cubes


Method
Put the water in a jug
Slice the lemon and squeeze in the juice with the lemon squeezer, discarding any seeds.
Add sugar, black salt, cumin powder, chat masala, mint leaves, and ice-cubes.
Mix it all until the sugar dissolves and check the seasoning, adjust if you need to.
Pour into tall glasses and add lemon slices if using. Serve chilled.

Chicken Balti
Hari says
Well, well, well, what can I say about the wonderful dish that is the Balti? It seems to be a bit controversial, with many arguing over its origins. There are suggestions that it comes from Baltistan, a town in Northern Pakistan, while others claim that it was first served in Adil's restaurant in 1977 in Sparkbrook in Birmingham, which lays foundations to what was later known as the Balti triangle.

I do think that this is a wonderfully, fragrant dish that has definite Indian origins with Anglo parents. The truth is that the Balti actually refers to the dish that the curry is cooked in rather than the curry itself. The dish that it's cooked in is an Indian cast iron, round-bottomed wok with two handles calle a karahi.  The curry is characteristically a meat (or veg) dish with a thick, spicy tomato-based sauce. Usually, it's heavy on the chilli heat with a little tanginess from the yoghurt that's added. Brummie tradition has it that the sauce has to be mopped up with soft, fluffy naan bread! 

Top Tip: If you haven’t got the time to make this in the evening, then you can slow cook it so it’s ready for when you get in.

Ingredients
3cm ginger
6 garlic cloves
2 tomatoes, quartered
1½ tsp garam masala
1½ tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed 
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tbsp full-fat Greek yogurt
Salt, to taste
2 tbsp rapeseed oil
1 tsp brown mustard seeds
1 bay leaf
1 onion, finely chopped
6–10 whole green chillies, (reduce if this is too many for you)
500g boneless chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite-size chunks
Black peppercorns, freshly ground
1 tbsp lemon juice, or to taste
Large handful of finely chopped, fresh coriander leaves 

Method
Blend together the ginger and garlic in a pestle and mortar or blender and set to one side.
Grind the cumin and coriander seeds and set to one side.
Blend the tomatoes to a paste and stir in the ground spices, garam masala, turmeric, Kashmiri chilli powder, yoghurt and salt.
Heat the oil in a non-stick saucepan (or karahi if you have one) and add the mustard seeds. 
Once the mustard seeds pop, add the bay leaf and chopped onion.
Stir and cook on a medium heat. After about 15 minutes add the minced ginger and garlic with the green chillies for at least 20-30 minutes until the onions are well browned. If the onions catch, add a splash of water and continue to cook the onions.
Stir in the blended tomatoes, spices and yoghurt mix. Turn the heat up and stir until the mixture thickens and you are left with a thick masala paste (10-15 minutes).
Add the chicken pieces and stir into the thick masala to coat it. 
Reduce the heat and place the lid on the pan. Leave to cook for about 20 minutes, stirring every now and again.
The chicken will produce a lovely thick gravy. Once the chicken is cooked through you can adjust the consistency of the sauce to your preference. To loosen, just add a little hot water, or to reduce it and make it thicker, cook further on a high flame. 
Once cooked, add some black pepper and a squeeze of lemon, then check the seasoning.
Stir in the chopped coriander and serve.

Chicken Balti Pie
Spicing up the very British Pie
Hari says
The Balti pie has become a match day delicacy that is enjoyed by so many football fans up and down the country each week. Personally - I love a pie, I love pastry and I love the spice of Indian dishes too, so what better then all those amazing flavours and textures all together to give the ultimate satisfactions.

This pie was actually created by a company called My Pie London - they loved my Chicken Balti recipe so much that they created a pie with my gorgeous chicken filling. They are a fantastic pie company created by Chef Chris Bumby who travels around in his Pie Van treating us to some of the best pies fillings ever.  From my Balti pie to a steak, Jalapenos and cheddar and many more - his pies rock!

For this pie I have just used some bought pastry - it is so easy to use. But if you want to make your own have a look at my Sausage Roll recipe and use the same method.

So here it is, the recipe for my Balti pie -  I just had to share it with you all and I hope you love it as much as I do!

Indian Sausage Rolls
Warming spiced minced pork sausage rolls
Hari says
Sausage rolls are a British party staple and I love them. Recently I bought some from a supermarket for my sons lunchbox and I was so disappointed! The pastry was tasteless and dry, the filling simply flavourless - they were like cardboard so I decided to get the kids to make some at home.  

As with everything I make myself I can't help but to jazz it up a bit so I added a few spices to give a warming flavour to the minced pork filling and they came out so moist and delicious that I will never buy them again. In terms of the pastry I have given you my recipe below which is fairly simple to make if you have the time but the stuff you can buy is just as good. 

I would love to hear what you think of these so please let me know in the comments below and post pictures of any that you make in my app - enjoy!

Ingredients
800g minced pork
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 medium onion, very finely diced
2 cloves garlic, very finely chopped
1 tbsp ginger, grated
1 green chilli, finely chopped
1 tsp salt
1 tsp chilli powder (optional)
large pinch fresh coriander, chopped
1 tsp garam masala
Pastry
Bought puff pastry 500g or
175g unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes
350g plain flour
Pinch of salt
3–4 tbsp iced water
Egg wash glaze 
1 egg, beaten
splash of milk
½ tsp turmeric
Kalonji seeds

Method
To make the spiced pork filling:
Sauté cumin seeds then add the diced onion, grated ginger grated, garlic, 1 chopped chilli. When soft leave to cool.
Mix the onion mixture with the minced pork, salt, chilli powder, chopped coriander leaves and garam masala and set to one side.
To make the pastry:
Combine the butter cubes in a bowl with the flour and salt, then add just enough water to bring together and make a firm dough.
Dust your surface with flour and roll out the dough away from you to make a rectangle about 1cm thick. Fold the two short ends into the middle so they overlap. Turn the pastry by 45 degrees and repeat process four or five more times.
Wrap the pastry in cling film and let it rest it in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to an rectangle that is about 5mm thick (45 x 15cm).
To make the sausage rolls:
Squash the pork mixture together and shape like a sausage. Lay it along the long side of the pastry, about 3cm in from the edge. Brush the edge of the pastry with the egg wash and fold the pastry over the top of the filling to enclose it. Crimp the edges using a fork to seal the filling inside. Slash the top of the pastry diagonally.
Using a brush, lightly brush the pastry with the turmeric, egg and milk wash, then scatter over the kalongi seeds.
Place the sausage roll in the fridge for 10 minutes or so to firm up.
To cook
Preheat the oven to 200°C
Cut the sausage roll into desired lengths (best with a serrated knife) and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
Bake in the oven for 35–45 minutes, until they are golden brown.
Remove the sausage rolls from the oven and place them onto a wire rack to cool (they are delicius hot). These can be kept in a air tight tub in the fridge for a 3-4 days.

A Bhuna is all about the style of cooking rather than the ingredients.
Hari says
This is an intensely flavoured dish that’s slow cooked until the meat is tender and becomes infused with a selection of spices - healthy as well as hearty.

The meat is then fried on a high heat to reduce or 'bhun' it so that it intensifies in flavour. This also creates a richly spiced sauce that clings lovingly to the chunks of meat.

To get the spices for my Bhuna, check out my curry kit here.

Top Tip:
If you haven’t got the time to make this in the evening, then you can slow cook it so it’s ready when you get in.

Ingredients Method
900g leg of lamb or mutton, trimmed and chopped
Spice Blend
2 tsp cumin seeds
3 tsp coriander seeds
2 tsp mustard seeds
2-3 dried chilli
2 tsp fennel seeds
1 tsp fenugreek seeds
Masala
2 onions, finely chopped
6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
20 curry leaves
4cm ginger, grated
400g / 1 tin plum tomatoes
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt
1 tsp garam masala
Handful coriander, chopped

Method
Heat a frying pan and add the cumin seeds, coriander, mustard, fennel, fenugreek seeds, and two or three dried chillies. Keep the spices moving for a minute or two until they go a shade darker. Empty the spices into a bowl and let them cool before grinding to a fine powder in a coffee grinder or with a pestle and mortar. Leave to one side.
Heat oil and add onions in a large pan, after a few minutes add the garlic.
Once they have browned add the curry leaves, with the ginger, tomatoes and salt. Cook until the tomatoes break down creating a thick paste.
Add the roasted spice mix and turmeric to the pan and stir well. Cook for a minute or two, taking care not to let the sauce catch on the bottom of the pan. If it does, add a splash of water and quickly stir.
Place the meat in the pan and stir to coat then cook for five minutes. Reduce the heat and put a lid on the pan and cook on a very gentle heat for about 30-40 minutes (longer if using mutton). Check that the meat is tender. If it isn't, leave it for a while longer.
When the meat is ready, remove the lid from the pan and turn up the heat and fry to reduce the sauce until it almost disappears. The aim is to create a dry, concentrated sauce that clings tightly to the tender meat.
Finish with a sprinkle of garam masala and a handful of chopped fresh coriander.

Chettinad Chicken
Hari says
A lovely flavoursome chicken curry dish from Tamil Nadu in South India. Chettinad Chicken is made by toasting a number of spices with coconut and producing an aromatic masala that has a slight aniseed scent. If you think it will be to fiery for you just reduce the number of chillies. Traditionally it is served with Dosa or Appams but it is just as good with a flaky Parathas and even plain boiled rice.

Lamb with Shallots
Hari says
This is a really flavoursome lamb dish that's cooked with whole pearl shallots for added texture and flavour. The gorgeous little onions add a warming sweetness when fried. Once they are all wrapped up in the deeply hearty flavour of masala sauce they add a delicious bite and crunch to the dish.  

Ingredients
20g unsalted butter
200g mini shallots or pearl onions, peeled
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 bay leaf
10 cloves
8 cardamom
8 dried chillies
4cm stick cassia bark
2 onions finely sliced
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt
6 garlic cloves, sliced
3 tbsp ginger, grated
200g tinned tomatoes
1kg diced leg of lamb or neck fillet
2 tsp garam masala
2 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp mace powder
1 tsp cumin seeds crushed
2 tsp black peppercorns, crushed
Handful of coriander leaves, chopped
2 tsp ginger, finely shredded

Method
Melt butter in pan and fry the small onions for a few minutes until golden brown. Remove and set to one side.
Add the oil to the pan and fry the bay, cloves, cardamom, chillies and cassia bark.
Add the sliced onions and cook until they become translucent
Stir in the turmeric, salt, ginger and garlic to soften then add the tomatoes. Stir and cook for 5 minutes until the tomatoes break down.
Add lamb and stir to coat with the masala, cook on a high heat for about 20 minutes to brown the meat.
Reduce the heat to lowest setting and cover with the lid and leave to simmer for 30-40 minutes.
Open the pan and stir in all the ground spices (garam masala, coriander, mace, cumin, black pepper)
Add the whole fried shallots back into the pan and stir. Leave them to soak up the flavours.
Check the seasoning and adjust if required. Sprinkle with coriander and shredded ginger to serve.

A traditional Indian chicken dish cooked with meat on the bone in a beautiful aromatic sauce.
Hari says
This was the first dish my mum made me cook on my own. The first time I had a go it turned out OK, but a little too watery and lacking in flavour. Luckily for you, I know what all the mistakes are, having made them all myself over the years! It's not just about throwing spices into your food, it's about how you bring all the ingredients together.

Always think about what you are looking to achieve and work towards it. This is my staple dish - when I have a craving for Indian food (which happens fairly regularly). It's a great one to keep in your recipe book for when you need a healthy Indian food-fix.

Top Tip: If you haven’t got the time to make this in the evening, then you can slow cook it so it’s ready when you get in.

Ingredients
8 pieces of chicken (4 legs cut into thigh and drumsticks)
Masala
2 tbsp of oil
2 onions, finely diced
3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
400g plum tomatoes
1 heaped tbsp of ginger, grated
1 tsp salt
1 tsp turmeric
Handful of coriander stalks, finely chopped
1 chilli, finely chopped
1 tsp of garam masala
Handful of coriander leaves, chopped

Method
Skin the chicken, removing any excess fat.
Heat oil in a pan and add the onion and garlic. Fry on a high heat for a few minutes then reduce the heat and cook gently for about 20 minutes until they turn a lovely dark golden brown. If they stick to the bottom of the pan reduce the heat and add a dash of hot water as and when required.
Once browned add the tinned tomatoes, ginger, salt, turmeric, coriander stalks and chopped chilli. Increase the heat to high.
Let the onions and tomatoes melt together creating a thick aromatic masala paste. This will take about 5-10 minutes so be patient! Once the paste is shiny and thick add the chicken pieces and stir to coat.
Turn the heat up and fry the chicken for 5 minutes.
Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and put the lid on the pan. Leave to cook for 20 - 25 minutes until the chicken is cooked and the meat is starting to fall away from the bone.
Once cooked, add enough boiling water to just cover the chicken and cook for another few minutes then remove from the heat.
Stir in the garam masala, throw in the coriander and serve.

Laal Maas
A red hot hunters dish from Rajasthan
Hari says
This is a fabulous dish that would have been cooked in the Rajasthan region by hunting parties while they were out hunting for meat. For this reason it is also called 'Jungli maas' or jungle meat. It is a really simple dish that you can imagine was cooked on open fires with just the ingredients the hunters could carry - dried chillies, salt and a bit of fat which probably came from the meat.

Just because this contains the simplest of ingredients doesn't meat it doesn't have a wonderful depth of flavour because it does. It's a vibrant red colour which comes from the Kashmiri chillies (of which there are a lot - please feel free to reduce the number used). The meat cooks so gently and becomes beautifully tender that it just melts away and what's more - it is so easy to cook.

Next time you are cooking for a real meat lover give this wonderful lamb curry a go you will not be sorry.

Ingredients
900g lamb leg, trimmed and chopped
20-30 dried Kashmiri chillies
1 tsp salt
100g Ghee

Method
Place all the ingredients into a heavy cast iron pan.
Put the lid on and place on a very gentle heat for one hour.
Stir occasionally and if required you can add a little water.

Slow Cooked Lamb Shanks
Slow cooked lamb shank with a delicious masala gravy perfect for that special dinner party
Hari says
This is a dish that I cooked recently for my friends who were all expecting a curry but this was more special because is was full of all the right aromas and flavours but it looked like it had just come out of a 5 star kitchen at a restaurant. If you prefer a smooth sauce you can blitz it with a hand blender and strain it.

This is a really nice dish to dress up when you are showing off (well we all like to do it) at a dinner party.

It's a really hearty, slow cooked dish that is packed full of wonderful earthy flavours and it's not that difficult to cook either, it just needs a bit of time. The gravy oozes depth with lovely warming flavours and the meat just melts away. 

Top Tip:
If you haven’t got the time to make this in the evening, then you can slow cook it so it’s ready when you get in. Find out more here.

Ingredients
4 tbsp of vegetable oil
5cm stick of cassia bark
4 cardamom pods
6 cloves
3 onions, peeled and finely sliced
4 lamb shanks
4cm piece of ginger
5 garlic cloves
3 green chillies, chopped
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
4 tbsp of plain Greek yoghurt
4 tomatoes
½ tbsp of garam masala, powder
handful of coriander, leaves
salt to taste

Method
Make sure you have a large enough sauce pan to fit in all your lamb shanks. Heat the oil and add the lamb shanks and on a high heat to just brown the meat on all sides. Remove the shanks and set to one side.
Add the cassia, cardamom, and cloves and sauté until the spices become fragrant (just a minutes).
Add the sliced onions and cook over a medium heat, until they are golden brown.
Crush the ginger and garlic in a pestle and mortar and add to the pan along with the green chillies.
Stir well for a couple of minutes and then add the turmeric, chilli, cumin and coriander powders and salt.
Add the chopped tomato and stir leave to simmer for 5-10 minutes to create a thick masala paste.
Once the onions and tomatoes have melted into the sauce stir in the yoghurt a little at a time, until it has all melted into the sauce. 
Put the shanks back into the pan and coat with the masala. Reduce the heat and leave this to cook for about 30 minute.
Add hot water to cover the meat on the shanks and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cover with a lid.
Leave the meat to cook until the lamb is soft and coming away from the bone, approximately 3 hours. 
Check the seasoning and adjust if required. Sprinkle with garam masala and some chopped coriander leaves.

Mutton Raan
A lavish mutton dish which is marinated for 48 hours then slow cooked until the meat is melting away from the bone!
Hari says
I love discovering dishes that are old classics but because they are so special they just seem to work across different cultures. Lucky for you this is one of those.

This raan makes an amazing centre piece for your Sunday roast dinner and can be served with saffron potatoes and spiced green beans but it's just as wonderful cooked slowly on an indirect heat in the barbecue too.

This is a dish that needs a bit of planning (as well as space in the fridge to marinade) but it is really easy to create. I gave this recipe to a friend of mine who wanted to go Indian for Christmas lunch and it went down an absolute storm.

The mutton is scored down to the bone marinated in a fragrant spice dry rub for 24 hours then it's smothered in a wet nut and yoghurt paste for another 24 hours. This tenderises the meat and allows it to soak up the wonderful flavours. The gentle spicing gives the mutton the essence of Indian flavours without them being too strong.

This works with lamb and I have also done it with a whole turkey too which was simply wonderful

Two marinades over two days, cooked low and slow - result tender meat melting away from the bone with a warming spiced gravy.

Ingredients
2kg leg of mutton
Dry rub
4 garlic cloves, crushed
3cm piece of ginger, grated
4cm stick of cassia bark
5 cardamom pods
2 black cardamom pods
1 tsp fennel seeds
3 cloves
1 tsp of chilli powder
1 tsp of turmeric
1 tsp of salt
Marinade
250g yoghurt
100g pistachios
100g almonds
Large pinch of saffron
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
Drizzle of honey

Method
Trim the leg removing the fat and make 3 deep cuts down the length of the bone. Then make 3 slices across the leg. Turn it over and do the same of the other side
Peel the garlic and blend with all the dry rub spices to make a paste. Rub this all over the leg and into the cuts. Cover with cling film and leave to marinade overnight.
Soak saffron in a little water.
In a grinder blend the nuts to a powder (you can also crush them in a pestle and mortar).
Mix the nuts, saffron water, yoghurt salt and pepper in a bowl. Smear this all over the leg and massage it into the meat. Cover with cling film and leave to marinade overnight.
Heat the oven to 220°C and remove from the clingfilm. Place the meat on a rack over a oven tray. Cover with foil and cook for half an hour. Reduce the heat to 160°C and cook for 4-5 hours.
In the last half hour remove the foil and drizzle with honey.
Once cooked cover with foil and leave the meat to rest for up to an hour so it is tender and juicy.
Spoon off some of the fat from the juices then heat through, pour this over the meat before serving.

Served with
Serve with cumin roast potatoes as a not so British roast dinner or go down the more Indian route with some delicate saffron rice.

Asparagus and Pea Soup with Parsnip Crisps
Share this recipe:FacebookTwitterPinitgPlusEmail
A traditional south Indian spiced consomme
Hari says
If you love a good soup then this is a delicious one to try. For me, it tastes of summer with gorgeous seasonal asparagus and fresh peas. Sometimes I use the offcuts of asparagus to make this and do something more glamorous with the spears. The parsnip chrisps make a great healthier alternative to croutons and the soup has a wonderful colour and a lovely light flavour. Gently place the parsnip crisps on top when serving to really wow your dinner guests.

Ingredients Method
Soup
1 tbsp butter
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 tbsp plain flour
340g asparagus
250g peas
pinch cracked black pepper, or to taste
Salt to taste
Parsnip Crisps
1 parsnip
oil for frying
salt 

Method
Soup
Heat butter in a pan and add the garlic. Cook to soften then stir in the chopped onion.
Stir and leave to cook for 2 or 3 minutes.
Stir in flour and roast for a minute or so to lose the rawness. 
Add 500ml of water and stir ensuring there are no lumps.
Add the asparagus, peas, salt and pepper and bring to the boil
Leave the pan to simmer until asparagus has cooked (about 15-20 minutes).
Pour the soup into a blender and blitz until smooth.
Pour through a strainer and return to the heat for a few minutes, check the seasoning then remove from the heat.
Parsnip Crisps
Heat some oil to deep fry the crisps in.
Peel the parsnip and using your peeler strip off thin slivers.
To check the oil is hot enough place in a sliver of the parsnip into the oil. If it bubbles and crisps up its ready.
Continue with the remaining slivers and place onto some kitchen roll to drain.
Sprinkle with a little salt and serve on top of the soup.

Cauliflower Shorba
A gorgeous wholesome soup with lovely earthy Indian flavours which is low in calories as an added bonus.
Hari says
In India a shorba is usually a drink rather than a thick soup and they are consumed when it's cold as a warming drink to warm the hands as well as the body. They tend to be packed with herbs and spices and are spicy to give you a hearty health boost when the cold weather hits.  

Cauliflower makes a really wonderful shorba that's simple to make yet bursting with depth. You can add other vegetables to this if you want to make it into more of a mixed vegetable soup. I have made this one fairly thick so it can be eaten as a delicious warming lunch dish or as a starter but if you want to go for the real deal then just add some hot water and sip in cups.

Ingredients
2 tbsp oil
1 bay leaf
6 cloves of garlic, sliced
1 green chilli
1 tsp salt
1 small cauliflower, chopped
750ml water
1 tsp cumin, roasted and roughly crushed

Method
Heat oil and add a bay leaf. Stir in the garlic and sauté until brown.
Roughly chop the chilli and add to the pan.
Add the chopped cauliflower and salt then cover with the water and bring to the boil.
Leave to simmer for about 20-30 minutes until the cauliflower is soft.
Blitz the soup in a liquidiser (if you want it think like an authentic shorba then push it through a seive).
Return to the stove and simmer for 5 minutes.
Serve in small bowls topped with a sprinkling of roasted cumin.

Curry flavours infused into a warming butternut squash soup. Food for the soul!
Hari says
This is a bit of a hybrid dish that brings together Indian and Asian flavours with the amazing bell shaped vegetable that is the butternut squash.

It's a wonderful winter squash that can be found everywhere from September to December. It has a sweet and delicious flavour and the most invitingly vivid orange colour. If you're looking for a cuddle and need something that will warm you up, then this soup is just perfect.

Roasting the squash brings out the sweetness which perfectly combines with the heat from the chillies, the cream from the coconut and the warmth of the cumin all blitzed together leaving you with a little bowl of deliciousness for you to enjoy!

Print
Ingredients Method
1 butternut squash
1 red onion, chopped
1 tsp cumin seeds
2 garlic cloves, chopped finely
3cm piece ginger, grated
2 red chillies, chopped (keep some for garnish)
500ml water or chicken stock
50ml coconut cream

Method
Slice the squash into four long strips, remove the seeds and place on a tray with a little knob of butter on each and roast at 180°C for about 35 minutes until soft.
Meanwhile heat some oil and add cumin seeds until fragrant, then add onions and cook gently until soft.
Stir in the garlic and ginger and chilli and cook gently for about 5 minutes.
Once the squash is soft scrape the flesh out and discard the skin. Stir the flesh into the onions.
Add the stock and cook through until everything is soft (about 5 minutes).
Using a hand blender blitz the soup until it's smooth and thick. Pour in the coconut cream and if it's too thick add a little hot water.
Pour into bowls and top with a swirl of coconut cream and a chopped chilli. Serve with some crisp naan bread.

An authentic very hot and spicy warming root ginger soup
Hari says
My mum would make this when ever she was feeling a bit under the weather and needed a little pick me up. This recipe is very quick to make which is what you want when you are feeling a bit rough, just remember it's also pretty hard hitting. Not only does it warm you up inside, it also brings your mouth to life too so if you are suffering with a sore throat I would leave the chilli out.

Ginger has so many known health benefits from warming properties, to helping with tummy issues and it's also known to boost the immune system especially when you have a cold or flu. It is also a safe way of relieving nausea and and sickness during pregnancy. As an added bonus it tastes great too and has a citrus freshness which is lovely.

So next time you are suffering with a sniffly nose, and feeling a bit bunged up give this soup a go and bring your body back to life.

Ingredients
Paste
5cm piece of fresh ginger, roughly chopped
1 fresh chilli, chopped
3 cloves of garlic
200g of tinned tomatoes
200ml water
Masala
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp salt
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp garam masala
Garnish
handful of fresh coriander, chopped
ginger julienne

Method
Paste
Put all the ginger, chilli, garlic, into a blender and blend to a paste. Then add the tomatoes and water.
Masala
Heat the oil in a pan and add cumin seeds and fry for a few seconds until they pop and become fragrant but be careful as they burn very quickly.
Add paste very carefully as it will spit. Bring to the boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.
Add salt, turmeric, garam masala and leave to simmer for a few minutes. It will be a fairly liquidy consistency.
Check the seasoning and adjust to taste.
Garnish
Remove from the heat, stir in the fresh coriander, and top with a sprinkle of ginger strips. Serve in a bowl with some buttered roti.

Garlic and Mushroom Shorba
Hari says
I love garlic and I love mushrooms and because they go great together here is a delicious, little spiced soup for you all to try. To make it a little richer you can also add a touch of cream, but this one was finished with a dash of chilli powder because I was in need of a chilli hit and some garam masala because it was freezing and I needed to warm up. 

I like this dish to be a fairly thick consistency although a traditional shorba would be much more watery - this way I can dunk in some naan for a more filling meal! 

Ingredients
1 tbsp Oil
5 cloves garlic, chopped
salt and pepper, to taste
300g chestnut mushrooms, quartered
2tsp flour
2 tsp butter
600ml water

Rasam
A traditional south Indian spiced consomme packed with healthy ingredients
Hari says
Rasam is a personal favourite of mine, I can't tell you how perfect it is on those days when you just can't seem to warm up. It's a great winter warmer because it's hot, spicy and full of zingy healthy goodness that will ward off any sign of a sniffle on top of tasting great. 

I love that it's super simple to make, so if you are feeling a bit low it doesn't need much concentration - just chuck it all in, boil and sip away.

I think it makes a great little amuse bouche too, so when you are throwing that classy dinner party, you can warm your guests to the flavours of the east with a little Indian soup served in tiny cups.

Ingredients
Paste
4 cloves garlic
10cm ginger
20 curry leaves with stalks

A healthy cauliflower and potato recipe, combined with a thick tomato sauce made with onions, garlic, ginger and whole cumin and mustard seeds.
Hari says
I was about seven or eight years old when my mum and dad had to fly back to India unexpectedly, leaving us to and stay with a family friend. After a week of indulging in 80s English meals (something we didn't have often so it was a real novelty) we all started to crave my mums food. So my sister and I decided to cook aloo gobi. Nervous about getting it wrong, we phoned my aunty to ask if we could cook the cauliflower in one giant lump or did we need to cut it into pieces... I can still hear her laughing and even now they bring up that little story. At that point that I realised how important it was to be able to cook. Needless to say, our version wasn't a patch on my mum's, but this recipe absolutely makes up for that. And the robust tomato sauce is very special and if you can hold your nerve and not add water, it will be cooked to perfection.

Ingredients
1 small cauliflower
2 potatoes, peeled cut into 4cm cubes
2 tbsp mustard oil
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
200g/½ tin tomatoes
1 tbsp ginger, grated
1 tsp salt
1 tsp turmeric
1 chilli, finely chopped
1 tsp dried fenugreek
1 tsp garam masala
Handful chopped fresh coriander

Method
Prepare your cauliflower by cutting into florets, wash and drain. Ensure it's thoroughly dry before cooking.
Heat the oil in a karahi and add the mustard seeds. Once sizzling add the cumin seeds.
Add the onions and garlic then fry until soft and lightly browned.
Once browned reduce the heat a little and add the tomatoes, ginger, salt, turmeric, chilli and dried fenugreek leaves.
Continue to cook so the onions and tomatoes melt together to create a thick, aromatic masala paste.
Add the potatoes and stir to coat with the sauce.
Reduce the heat, cover the pan with the lid and leave to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the cauliflower and stir into the sauce to coat. Replace lid and leave to cook for a further 25-30 minutes until cooked.
Turn the vegetables occasionally but do not stir too vigorously as you don't want the cauliflower or potato to turn mushy. Once cooked sprinkle with garam masala and fresh coriander before serving.

Served with
As a side or a main I like to eat aloo gobi with either a roti or the slightly more indulgent parantha to scoop up the soft florets and potatoes. Often eaten as breakfast in India it is beautiful with a hot lime or lemon pickle.

Aloo Bangun
This potato and aubergine curry recipe is cooked in a robust tomato sauce, flavoured with whole cumin and mustard seeds.
Hari says
There are a few things that I've inherited from my mum and one of those is to never waste food (I imagine yours said the same!). For example, my mum would use the whole of the aubergine, including the stalk end which she would cook as part of the dish. She would then search through the pot and pull out the stalks and eat them herself. Even now I'm not sure if that was her being a martyr so we would all have more to share or whether it was her being selfish and saving the best bit of the aubergine curry for herself. Either way, I've inherited her 'use it all' cooking style and now save the stalks for myself. You try it!

Ingredients
2 aubergines, cut into 3cm lengths
2 potatoes, peeled and cut into 3cm lengths
2 tbsp mustard oil
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 onion, finely sliced
200g/½ tin tomatoes
1 tbsp ginger, grated
1 tsp salt 
1 tsp turmeric
1 chilli, finely chopped
1 tsp garam masala
Handful fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Heat the oil in a wok or karahi and add 1 tsb of mustard seeds. Once sizzling, add 1 tsp cumin seeds and fry until they become fragrant.
Then add 1 sliced onion and continue to cook until soft and lightly browned. .
Reduce the heat a little and add 200 g tomatoes, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp turmeric, 1 finely chopped chilli and 1 tbsp grated ginger. .
Cook until the onions and tomatoes melt together to create a thick, aromatic masala paste (5-10 minutes). .
Add 2 cubed potatoes and stir to coat with the sauce. Reduce the heat cover the pan with the lid and leave to cook for 5 minutes. Add a little drop of water if required. .
Stir in the 2 cubed aubergines and coat them with the masala. .
Replace lid and leave to cook for 25-30 minutes stirring occasionally, until cooked through. .
Once soft and cooked through sprinkle the curry with garam masala and fresh coriander before serving.

I love to eat aloo bangun as side dish, but it has to always be with roti so you can scoop up all the lovely soft potatoes and aubergine curry sauce. I have also been known to use this as a filling for my lunch time wrap with some crisp salad.

Masala Mashed Potato
An Indian twist on one of my favourite things
Hari says
I love mashed potato. I actually love it so much that when I was a child, I used to eat mashed potato sandwiches. Yep, it's true!

Mash potato is one of the easiest things to make but when it goes wrong, it's horrible so I have a few rules:

Choose the right potato - high starch, low moisture variety like Maris Piper.
Peel and cut into even chunks.
Bring to a rolling boil then reduce to a simmer for about 20 minutes until soft and cooked through.
Drain and return the potatoes to the hot pan so the excess moisture evaporates.
Never let your potatoes go cold before you mash them.
Only ever use a potato masher, ricer or food mill to mash your potato. A blender or processor will break down the potato cells too much, releasing starch and making your mash gluey.
Add warm milk or cream and butter that is at room temperature and mix into the mash.
Don't over-work your potatoes or they will end up gloopy.
Once you've got your mash right, why not try my Indian twist? It's lovely, it looks amazing and tastes even better!

Ingredients
4-5 large potatoes, peeled and chopped into chunks
2 tbsp ghee
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 small onion, diced
½ tsp turmeric
3cm piece ginger, grated
2 chillies, finely chopped
60ml cream or milk
salt to taste
handful coriander, chopped

Method
Cook the potatoes in water until soft. Mash while they are still hot and set to one side. 
Heat the ghee in a pan and add the cumin seeds. Once fragrant, add the diced onion to soften for about 5 minutes.
Stir in the ginger, chillies and turmeric, cook for a few seconds and add the mash.
Stir though so it all turns a beautiful yellow colour. 
Reduce the heat and add the cream (you can use milk if you prefer). Stir until it's fully absorbed. 
Remove from the heat, season with some salt and stir through the fresh coriander and serve.

Spiced Jerusalem Artichokes
Jeruselum artichokes folded into a dry Indian masala makes a wonderfully crunchy and healthy Indian side dish
Hari says
Jerusalem artichokes are part of the sunflower family and are sometimes called sunroot or earth apples, because they are the tubers of the plant and grow underground. They are completely different from globe artichokes, which come from the thistle family.

Jerusalem artichokes can be used in many different ways but in general they're used in the same way as potatoes. They have a crunchy texture similar to water chestnuts with a slightly nutty flavour and can also be used raw in salads.

With this recipe I like to keep the masala dry and pungent to infuse lots of spice into the dish while keeping it light on calories. It's important to use cumin and the asafoetida not only for flavour but also to balance the digestive properties of this vegetable. This is a wonderful alternative to a side of Bombay potatoes. Try something different!

Ingredients
500g Jerusalem artichokes
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 heaped tsp cumin seeds
large pinch of asafoetida
1 green chilli, chopped
½ tsp salt
1 lemon
1 tsp garam masala
Handful of fresh coriander

Method
Wash and scrub the artichokes, then peel and chop them into 4cm cubes.
Heat oil in a wok or karahi, add cumin seeds and asafoetida powder.
Once the seeds crackle, add the chillies and salt and add the chopped artichokes.
Stir and coat them with the spices and leave them to cook on a gentle heat for about 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cook them to the texture you like — I like mine with a crunch. Remove from the heat.
Squeeze in a little fresh lemon juice, sprinkle the garam masala and transfer to a bowl.
Sprinkle with the fresh coriander to finish.

Deliciously hot and spicy potatoes cooked very simply with a warming bite of mustard seeds and fragrance of curry leaves.
Hari says
This is a really fast and easy side dish to cook. Whenever I have a people over for dinner I always seem to have a last-minute panic that all the food is going to disappear too quickly - so this is the dish I cook to pad out the meal. Funnily enough, this is always the one that people ask for the recipe for, rather than the main centre piece. There's a compliment in there somewhere. Anyway, this is a really quick thing to cook and it's a lovely way to jazz up your potatoes. Ideally you'll serve up deliciously spiced individual cubes of potatoes, so try not to stir them too much. You don't to be serving a bowl of Indian mash potato... although that actually sounds rather good!

Ingredients
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp mustard seeds
5 curry leaves
1 onion, sliced
2 green chillies, finely chopped
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp coriander seeds
½ tsp red chilli powder (optional)
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt
2 potatoes, cut into chunks
1 tsp garam masala
Handful fresh coriander, finely chopped

Method
Heat the oil in a pan and add the mustard seeds and curry leaves.
Once the mustard seeds splutter stir in the onions and cook until they turn a light golden brown colour.
Place the coriander and cumin seeds into a pestle and mortar and pound to a powder. Add this, the turmeric, green chillies and chilli powder to the onions.
After a minute the spices will become fragrant, stir in the potatoes and salt then cook for about 5 minutes.
Reduce the heat and stir in a splash of water. Place the lid on the pan and leave to steam for about 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are soft.
Remove from the heat and finish with one teaspoon garam masala and a handful of fresh coriander.

Served with
For me this is a wonderful side dish to have with almost any Indian meal to improve the delicious experience. I do also like to use this as a stuffing for peppers or sometimes even on toast.

Amazing Nut Roast
Hari says
The nut roast is one of those dishes that people feel a bit sorry for - it has the reputation of being the sad alternative to a gorgeous piece of roast meat. Well, I'm here to tell you to leave your sympathy at the door. My nut roast is so delicious that it's the dish that always get polished off first at our table and we are a family of meat lovers! 

When I have vegetarian friends round for dinner I don't just want to serve up the same food excluding the meat; I want them to feel like I have thought about them too so this makes a beautiful roast dinner dish for your vegetarian friends. The texture from the nuts, the creaminess of the cheese and flavour of all the vegetables combined with the lentils and spices take this dish to another level. 

Easy, full of goodness and packed to the brim with flavour - now that's what I call good food. 

Ingredients
1 tbsp ghee or oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 dried chilli
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
3cm ginger
200g chestnut mushrooms, sliced
100g paneer grated
1 large carrot, grated
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
½ tsp turmeric
100g red lentils
2 tomatoes, chopped
300ml water
100g walnuts and cashews, roughly chopped
100g mature cheddar cheese, grated
Handful of fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Preheat the oven to 180ºC or gas mark 4.
Line the base and sides of a 1.5-litre loaf tin with parchment paper.
Heat the ghee in a large frying pan and add the cumin seeds and dried chilli until fragrant.
Add the onions and cook for about 5 mins until they start to soften.
Stir in the garlic and ginger and stir for a few minutes.
Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they soften then stir in the paneer and grated carrot. Cook the mixture for about 3 mins then add the chilli powder and turmeric and cook for just a minute.
Add the tomatoes and cook for about 1 minute until they start to break down a little, then add the water and season with salt.
Stir in the lentils and bring to the boil then leave to simmer over a very gentle heat until all the liquid has been absorbed and the mixture is fairly dry (about 10 minutes). Set aside to cool a little.
Roughly chop the nuts and stir in with the cheese and coriander.
Once mixed through, spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and press down into the tin.
Cover with foil and bake for 20 mins, then remove the foil and bake for a further 10–15 minutes until firm when pressed gently.
Allow the loaf to cool in the tin for about 10 mins then turn out onto a serving board or a plate and slice into lovely thick pieces.

Sprouts with Cumin and Mustard
Seasonal sprouts fragranced with cumin and mustard seeds.
Hari says
I'm always looking ways to jazz up the old sprout, not for me, because I love them as they are, but for everyone else. It's a long running joke in our house that my mother-in-law (who doesn't get all that excited about vegetables in general) has to eat at least one sprout at Christmas. I've cooked them with bacon, cream, and pickled veg in the past, so this year I decided to do the Indian thing and introduce a few choice spices. 

I know what you are thinking - spices really? Well, it's a funny thing but they are really, really good. A bit like the saag my mum made with them one Christmas (I thought "that's just wrong" but it worked). The combination of spices and simple preparation makes it a welcome addition to Christmas dinner. Now it's just up to my mum-in-law to decide! 

Ingredients
500g sprouts, cleaned and halved
1 tbsp ghee
2 tsp cumin seeds
2 tsp mustard seeds
2 onions, peeled and finely chopped
1 tbsp ginger, minced
1 tbsp garlic, minced
1 tsp chilli powder or to taste
salt to taste

Method
Heat ghee and add cumin and mustard seeds until they pop.
Add onions and cook for about 5-10 mins until just browning.
Add the ginger and garlic and cook for a few more minutes.
Stir in chilli powder and salt.
Add the sprouts with a little water and cook for about 5 mins until cooked (I like to leave mine a little crisp).

Cashew Nut Curry
Yes that's right it's cashew nut curry
Hari says
A unique curry dish that is so good, so simple to make and so full of good stuff it's untrue. It's great to be able to give your vegetarian friends something a bit different once in a while and provided they don't have a nut allergy this one of those dishes.

The coconut based creamy sauce combined with the lovely texture of the nuts is such a great combination and it's just so moorish.

Print
Ingredients Method
250g cashew nuts
2 tbsp coconut oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
10 curry leaves
2 green chillies, chopped
½ tsp roasted cumin seeds, ground
½ ground turmeric
1 tsp chilli powder
7cm stick of cassia 
300 ml coconut milk
150 ml coconut cream

Method
Soak the cashew nuts in a small bowl of water for an hour. Once softened, drain off the water and set to one side to dry off.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a pan once hot add the cumin, cassia and curry leaves. 
After a few seconds the spices will become aromatic, you can then add the chopped onions and stir to cook them for about 10 minutes.
When the onions begin to change to a golden brown stir in the turmeric, salt, chilli powder, green chillies and stir.
Add the drained cashew nuts and stir to combine with the spices.
Pour in the coconut milk and let it heat through. Leave it to simmer, thicken and reduce.
Remove the curry from heat and check the seasoning - adjust if required. I like to serve with some rice topped with a little extra coconut cream.

Beautifully tender lamb in a wonderful thick sauce, full of flavour and entwined with chunky onions.
Hari says
I absolutely love lamb, whether it's a slow roasted shoulder, a grilled chop or simply stewed in a curry. This lamb dish is one of my most popular as it's so simple to cook but has a really rich and intense flavour. And it's a dish that can be left to pretty much cook itself and doesn't need much doing to it. 

It's also slightly different to most curry dishes and the style is fairly close to a balti in that it's given a blast in a caste iron karahi once the meat is soft. It's a bit like cooking backwards because the steps are in the wrong order. The meat is tenderised and infused with ginger and garlic first, the fresh masala sauce is cooked simply from fresh tomatoes and lemony coriander seeds and then the onions are added at the end to give a chunky texture. I also add butter which increases the intensity even further. Lovely stuff.

Ingredients
600g leg of lamb or lamb neck fillet, trimmed and cubed
5 whole garlic cloves, peeled
1 tbsp ginger, grated
1 tsp salt
Masala
2 tbsp butter/ghee
3 fresh tomatoes, finely chopped
1 tsp turmeric
2 chillies, chopped finely
3 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
3 tsp of cumin seeds, crushed
1 tsp red chilli powder (optional)
1 onion, finely sliced
2 whole chillies, sliced lengthways
1 tsp garam masala
Handful coriander, chopped

Method
Place the diced lamb in a pan with garlic, ginger and salt and put the lid on the pan. Leave to cook on the lowest heat setting for 30-50 minutes until tender. Please don't worry, I promise it will not burn, it will just cook gently in its own juices until it is beautifully soft and has drawn in all the garlic and ginger flavours. Stir occasionally. 
In a karahi/wok heat the butter, add tomatoes and turmeric then fry to create a thick masala paste.
Add the chopped chilli, crushed cumin and coriander seeds, red chilli powder and then fry for a few minutes.
Stir in the cooked lamb with all the juice from the meat into the karahi/wok and begin to stir-fry with the tomato masala. After a few minutes add the sliced onions and halved chillies.
Stir fry the meat until the sauce thickens and you are left with it clinging to the meat entwined with delicious chunky slices of onion.
Sprinkle in the garam masala and a handful of coriander to serve.

Served with
This wonderful lamb dish deserves to be eaten with light fluffy rotis so you can scoop up the tender pieces of meat and scrape up the thick luscious rich sauce.

Succulent mutton cooked in a rich gravy made with aromatic whole spices and minced mutton.
Hari says
Now as far a special dishes go this one is definitely up there with the best of them. It's cooked with a whole concoction of wonderful whole spices that leaves the dish pungent and beautifully fragrant. Cooked very much in the north Indian style with onions, ginger and garlic and left to bubble away until the mutton, (when cooked properly produces a wonderful gravy) is soft and tender. This dish not only has chunks of mutton it's also cooked with mince mutton as well - now that is going to be an amazing dish right there.

My recommendations ... don't rush this one, let it simmer away and do its thing, I can assure you it will be truly amazing. 

Ingredients
3 tsp rapeseed oil
Whole Spices
7cm piece of cassia bark 
2 whole black cardamom
4 green cardamoms
5 whole black peppercorns
4 cloves
1 star anise
2 bay leaves
1 tsp cumin seeds
Masala
2-3 onions finely chopped
1 tbsp ginger, grated
7 garlic cloves, minced
8 dry whole red Kashmiri chillies
4 tomatoes finely chopped
1 tsp turmeric
salt to taste
250g minced mutton or lamb
500g mutton or lamb chopped (800-900g if on the bone)
1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
2 tbsp Greek yoghurt
1 tsp garam masala
handful of coriander leaves, chopped

Method
Pour oil into a heavy based pan and fry all the whole spices until fragrant.
Add the onion and garlic and cook for about 10 minutes until soft and browned. 
Meanwhile soak the Kashmiri chillies in some boiling water to let them soften. 
Stir in the tomatoes and ginger and leave to cook until they start to breakdown.
Add the turmeric, the crushed coriander seeds and the soaked chillies.
Add the mince and stir it into the sauce until it browns.
Turn the heat up and add the pieces of mutton and give it all a good stir so the meat begins to heat through.
Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and let it simmer slowly for about 40-60 minutes.
When the meat is tender turn up the heat and fry it so the sauce reduces and thickens.
Reduce the heat and stir in the yoghurt one spoonful at a time and remove from the heat.

Rajasthani Lamb
A gorgeously hot lamb dish cooked with lots of dried red chillies and yoghurt
Hari says
This is a lovely lamb dish originating in the Rajasthan region. It has two unique features firstly the dish uses of lots of dried chillies and secondly the sauce is made with yoghurt. There are different ways of putting this dish together, you can either make up a marinade by grinding the spices and mixing with the yoghurt to infuse flavour into the meat or you can do it this way. I like to use whole spices in my dishes so I cook the dish with the whole spices and leave it to cook low and slow until the meat just melts away. It's also fantastic when cooked with mutton.

Ingredients
900g leg of lamb, trimmed and cubed
1 tbsp rapeseed oil (or vegetable oil)
1 tsp cumin seeds
5 cloves
6 green cardamom
1 bay leaf
10 dried chillies
5 onions, diced
6 garlic cloves
1 tbsp ginger, grated
1 tsp salt
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder
200ml full fat Greek yoghurt

Method
Heat the oil in a heavy based pan and add the cumin seeds, once they sizzle add the 10 chillies, cracked cardamom, cloves and bay leaf. 
Add the onion and on a gentle heat, after a few minutes add the garlic and cook for about 20 minutes until golden brown.
Stir in the ginger then increase the heat and stir in the meat to seal and cook for about 10 minutes.
Add the salt, turmeric and chilli powder.
Whisk the yoghurt and pour into the meat. Heat through and then reduce the temperature and place the lid on the pan. Leave this to simmer away very gently for about 40 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

Hari says
These are delicious little spice bombs packed full of flavour that are super easy to make. I can promise you everyone will love them (unless your friends don't eat meat that is).

The children love them (just remember to leave the chilli out for them), the guys will love them especially with a cold beer and because they a little nibbles your girlfriends will love them too.

It's the type of dish that vanishes as soon as you bring it out so make sure you do enough.
I love to serve these as a pre-dinner snack with some 5 spice Indian tomato chutney or a hot and tangy Mint chutney.

Ingredients
400g mince lamb
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
½ tsp salt
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tsp chilli powder (add a little more for more of a kick)
2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp cinnamon
handful fresh coriander, finely chopped

Method
In a large mixing bowl add the mince lamb with all the other ingredients except the oil.
Mix everything together using your hands to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.
Rub a little oil on to your hands to stop the mixture sticking to your fingers.
Take a small amount of the meat and roll in your palms to make a meatball. Ensure it is smooth all over and set to one side. Repeat with the rest of the mixture.
Heat the oil in a frying pan.
Carefully fry the meatballs (kofta) in batches so they brown and crisp up all over (15-20 mins).
Remove the kofta using a slotted spoon and set them on some kitchen paper to drain.
Serve as a little snack or serve 2 or 3 as a lovely starter.

An easy to make, fresh salad of finely chopped summer vegetables.
Hari says
So simple yet so delicious, a Kachumbar salad isn't far off what you'd usually make in terms of shredding or cutting vegetables. But this one has an Indian twist of garam masala for an added warmth, as well as coriander for that heady, herby aroma. Try it with any starter from chicken wings to samosas - it will enhance them all.

Ingredients
1 small red onion
2 tomatoes
1 chilli, finely chopped
Fresh coriander leaves
Juice from 1 lemon
1 tsp salt
½ tsp garam masala
1 tsp kalonji seeds

Method
Cut the onions, tomato, chilli into a very fine dice and place into a bowl.
Finely chop the coriander and place into the bowl.
Squeeze in the lemon and sprinkle in the salt, garam masala, kalonji seeds - stir and serve.

Served with
A lovely fresh Indian salad that works beautifully as a side to any meal.

Chilli Paneer Recipe
Hari says
It seems that the Indian population just can't get enough of the hybrid Indo-Chinese food that is so readily available across India. It is so popular that it's served everywhere from roadside carts to markets to the very poshest restaurants. These spiced recipes with noodles, chicken, paneer and vegetables are all prepared using Chinese cooking styles but with an Indian flair that is perfect for the Indian palette.
This Chilli Paneer recipe contains flavours which are bold with lots of garlic, ginger and chilli (similar to Indian food I hear you say) the difference here is the use of soy and a little sugar to balance it out and create the delicious gravy for this dish.
I like to use Sriracha chilli sauce in my recipe which has garlic, chilli, vinegar and a flavour that works beautifully. But you can make a quick chilli sauce instead by blitzing chillies, garlic, salt, vinegar and sugar to a paste and use that if you prefer.

Ingredients
400gms Paneer chopped into cubes
Oil for frying
Paneer Batter
3 tbsp plain flour
1 tbsp corn flour
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
Salt to taste
2 or 3 tbsps water
Chilli Sauce
2 tbsp rapeseed oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
3-4 Kashmiri chillies, soaked in hot water
3cm fresh ginger, roughly chopped
4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
1 red onion, chopped into cubes
1 red pepper, chopped into cubes
1 green chilli, slit lengthways 
1 tbsp soy sauce
Sea salt to taste (if required)
2 spring onions, finely sliced for garnish
large pinch of coriander, chopped

Method
Paneer Batter
In a small pan, heat up some oil to fry the paneer in.
Place all the ingredients for the batter into a bowl and add a little water to make a thick batter.
Place the paneer blocks into the batter to coat them completely. Once the oil is hot (just check by dropping in a little batter - if it sinks, and then rises immediately, it's ready). Fry the paneer until the cubes are golden brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain the paneer on kitchen paper and set aside.
Chilli Sauce
Blend the soaked chillies with the fresh ginger to make a paste.
Heat the oil on a medium heat and stir in the cumin seeds until fragrant.
Add the garlic and saute until it just starts to colour (be careful it doesn't burn).
Pour in the chilli and ginger paste and cook for a minute until the oil separates.
Add the red onions for a few minutes to soften, then add in the peppers and sliced chilli.
Stir in the soy sauce and a tiny splash of water if required.
Stir in the fried paneer so it's all coated in the sauce.  
Check the seasoning and adjust if required. Top with spring onions and coriander. Serve with some spiced noodles or rice.
 

Note: You can use Sriracha sauce if you dont want to make the chilli paste.

Ajwainy Monkfish
Meaty monkfish infused in a carom flavoured yoghurt marinade.
Hari says
Monkfish is great because it's a thick, meaty fish that can take on wonderful bold flavours. This gorgeous little marinade is a take on one that I picked up for another chef. I love the different flavours that come through and the colour is beautiful too. 
Carom has a very distinct flavour which is similar to that of thyme, but it's much stronger. One thing to remember when using carom is that it can totally over-power the flavour of your dish so don't be heavy-handed with it. The mustard and honey are key in this as I think it's really important to get a little sweetness through the marinade. I love to cook this on the barbeque too to add some earthy, smokey tones - it's just a delight!

Ingredients
500g monkfish, in thick chunks
First Marinade
3cm piece ginger
3 cloves garlic
1 green chilli, chopped finely
1 tbsp oil
½ tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
juice from 1 lemon
½ tsp Ajwain seeds
1 tsp salt or to taste
Juice from 1 lemon 
Second Marinade
1 tbsp gram flour
2 cm ginger, crushed
2 cloves garlic, crushed
½ tsp turmeric powder
½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tsp garam masala 
2 tbsp yoghurt
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp oil
1 heaped tsp mustard seeds
few springs of dill

Method
First Marinade
Put the ginger and garlic into a pestle and mortar and crush them to a paste.
Mix this and all the remaining ingredients for the first marinade in a large bowl and add the pieces of monkfish. Leave this for half an hour while you prepare the second marinade.
Second Marinade
Put the gram flour into a dry frying pan and heat to roast it. keep it moving and once you can smell a sweet aroma it is ready.
Crush the ginger and garlic and place into a second bowl add the gram flour and spices except the oil and mustard seeds.
In a pan, heat the oil and toast the mustard seeds. Once they pop remove the pan from the heat and add to the bowl with the second marinade in it. Mix together until it is all combined and pour into the bowl with the monkfish. Top with the dill springs.
Mix and leave until you want to cook the fish.
To Cook
Heat the oven to 180ºC and place the fish on a baking sheet.
Cook in the over for about 15-20 minutes until it has cooked through and just started to colour.

Monkfish Curry
Monkfish in a spiced coconut curry
Hari says
A robust fish curry that uses some very South Indian flavours. The mustard and fenugreek seeds combine to give this masala a unique quality all of which melts into a delightful creamy coconut sauce. I have added the option to spice this up with some fresh green chillies if you prefer a spicy dish.  Monkfish plays the perfect centrepiece to this dish because it's a chunky white fish with firm flesh that doesn't break up easily. It has a natural delicate flavour which is able to draw in all the aromas from the masala making you feel like you are sitting on a deckchair soaking up the Indian sunshine. You can also add prawns to this dish too which is lovely. The squeeze of lime adds a little zing that is super tasty. 

Ingredients
800g of monkfish fillet, cut into cubes
4 tomatoes, roughly chopped
200ml of hot water
1 tbsp coconut oil
½ tsp of black or brown mustard seeds
½ tsp of fenugreek seeds
10 fresh curry leaves or 15 dried
1 inch piece ginger, cut into julienne
1 onion, finely sliced
3-4 green chillies, sliced
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp cumin seeds
3 tsp of coriander seeds
1 tsp of Kashmiri chilli powder 
100ml of coconut milk
1 tsp salt
1 lime

Method
Wash the monkfish cubes and leave to drain.
In a blender, pulse the tomatoes into a purée with 200ml of water and set aside.
Slice the ginger, chillies and onions.
Heat 1 tbsp of coconut oil over a medium heat, then add in the mustard seeds.
Once they are crackling, stir in the fenugreek seeds followed by the curry leaves.
Dont let the fenugreek seeds colour then add the ginger, sliced onions and chillies. Stir and leave to cook until the onions are golden brown (10 minutes).
Stir in the puréed tomatoes and increase the heat.
Crush the cumin and coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar and add to the sauce with the turmeric and chilli powder.
Partially cover the pan and turn up the heat so that it starts to boil, leave the tomatoes to reduce and thicken for about 10-20 minutes.
Turn down the heat and pour in the coconut milk and salt to taste. Bring the curry back to the boil and reduce to a simmer.
Place in the pieces of fish and allow it to cook for about 2-3 minutes until the fish is just cooked through, then remove from the heat.
Squeeze in the juice of lime and check the seasoning. Serve immediately with some plain Basmati rice.

Fish cooked in a spicy paste of chilli and coconut with the tang of fruity tamarind and sweet onions.
Hari says
An iconic Indian dish which uses my favourite whole Kashmiri chillies as the key ingredient. In the south, it's all about frying a pungent spice paste to create the basis for a delicious sauce and fill your kitchen with a mouth-watering fragrance.
This dish uses some classic ingredients from the region from fresh coconut to tamarind for a robust, yet fresh and fragrant, flavour. I love this cooking style because it's all about cracking spices, squishing garlic, bashing ginger and slicing chillies. 'Argument Cooking' I call it.
We use the flat pestle and mortar to grind spices, the coconut scraper (The Coconut Scraper - that's going on my gravestone) and even a machete to split the coconut. Exciting stuff. Now, you can use coconut cream to create a thicker creamy sauce or you can go down the traditional path as I do and use water to make a thinner, lighter sauce. Either way, this is a classic curry packed wih fresh tastes you will just love.
Check out my Goan curry kits here for a handy packet of all the top quality spices you need for this recipe.

Ingredients
600g skinless white fish fillets, chopped into chunks
Marinade
Juice of 1 lemon
1 tsp turmeric powder
½ tsp salt
Spice paste
8 dried red chillies
80g fresh coconut, grated
3 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
1 onion, chopped
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tsp turmeric
2 cloves garlic
1 tsp tamarind extract
Sauce
2 tbsp of oil
1 onion, sliced
1 tomato, puréed
3 fresh chillies, slit lengthways
Handful of coriander, chopped

Method
Mix the salt, lemon juice and turmeric powder and rub over the fish chunks and leave to marinate for 30 minutes.
Soak the dried chilli in 250ml of warm water for 15 minutes. Drain and reserve the water.
Make up the spice paste by placing the soaked chillies, coconut, coriander seeds, chopped onion, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, garlic, tamarind extract and two tablespoons of the reserved soaking water in a blender and process to make a smooth paste.
Heat oil in a shallow wide based pan and add the sliced onion and fry to soften - do not brown. Add the spice paste and cook until golden brown. You may need a splash of water to ensure the paste doesn't burn.
Once aromatic stir in the tomato purée and fresh chillies and cook for a further five minutes.
Add water (or coconut milk if you prefer) to create a lovely sauce, bring to the boil and cook for a few more minutes. 
Reduce the heat and gently place the marinated fish with any juice into the pan and cook for between five and seven minutes until the fish is soft.
Sprinkle with coriander to serve.

All you need is some plain rice or naan and let the fish speak for itself.

Maacher Jhol
A classic Bengali-style fish curry adapted for you to love!
Hari says
Maacher Jhol is a classic Bengali dish usually eaten with rice. ‘Maacher’ means fish and ‘Jhol’ is gravy, and in the Bengal region this dish would be cooked using a freshwater carp known as Rohu or Hilsa. These are boney, oily fish so a good substitute for you would be steaks of kingfish, salmon or mackerel but if you prefer a white fish try pomfret, sea bass, red snapper, tilapia or halibut.

Traditional Bengali cooking is utterly unique and this recipe reflects that cooking style. Dishes always need the main ingredient to be fried in mustard oil before being added to the sauce; people from this region believe that this method enhances the flavours by allowing the meat or fish to absorb the spices in the gravy more effectively. But for us, I’ve drastically reduced the amount of oil that would traditionally be used. This makes it healthier and a little more tuned to our Western tastebuds.

Ingredients
4 large fish steaks (Kingfish, Salmon, Halibut)
1 tsp turmeric powder
½ tsp salt
3 tbsps mustard oil
10 minature potatoes
1 large bay leaf
5 green cardamom pods, bruised
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 large onion
5 cm ginger, crushed
3 garlic cloves, crushed
1 fresh chilli, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, finely chopped 
½ tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
2 tbsps Greek yogurt
2 green chillies, sliced lengthways
handful of fresh, green coriander, finely chopped 

Method
Wash the fish and pat dry with some kitchen paper. Place onto a dish and sprinkle with turmeric powder and salt. Rub this into the fish and set aside for 30 minutes.
In the meantime blitz the onion to get a paste.
When the fish has marinated, heat the mustard oil in a pan and fry the pieces of fish until each one is golden on both sides. Be gentle with the fish while it cooks then set to one side.
Use the same oil or add more if required and fry the potatoes until they are golden. Drain on kitchen towel and set to one side.
If needed add a little more oil and heat on medium heat. Add the bay leaf, cardamom pods and cumin seeds.
Once fragrant add the onion paste with the crushed ginger and garlic and fry for about 10 minutes.
Just as they turn golden in colour add the tomatoes, turmeric powder, crushed coriander seeds and chopped chillies.
Stir until fragrant then spoon in the yogurt and mix well.
Fry this for about 10 -15 minutes until it becomes shiny the add 1 or 2 cups of hot water.
Stir in the fried potatoes and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and leave the potatoes simmering to cook through.
Once they are soft and cooked through add the fried pieces of fish and stir gently.
Cook for a few minutes then remove from the heat and sprinkle with the chopped coriander leaves and sliced chillies to garnish. Serve immediately with some plain rice

Keralan Fish Curry
A rich, creamy south Indian dish that is brimming full of spices
Hari says
I love this fish dish and just packed full of seafood flavour. I like to use a meaty white fish such as Monkfish which works so well with the coconut flavour of this classic dish. And what is even more wonderful is that this dish takes very little cooking you can even make the sauce up before hand and add the fish at the last minute. Just be sure to treat your fish with care as you don't want it do break up. Enjoy!

Ingredients
750g firm white fish cut into chunks
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp salt
1 tbsp Coconut oil
1 tsp mustard seeds
20 curry leaves
5 shallots, finely sliced
4 garlic cloves, finely sliced
3cm piece of ginger, finely sliced
2 green chilli, finely sliced
1 tbsp Kashmiri chilli powder (this can be reduced to 2 tsp)
½ tsp turmeric
4 tomatoes, chopped
400ml tin coconut milk
Handful coriander, chopped

Method
Coat the fish in salt and turmeric
Heat a tbsp of coconut oil in a shallow large based pan.
Add the mustard seeds with the curry leaves till the seeds start to pop.
Add the sliced shallots, garlic, ginger and chilli, and cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes, till softened.
Mix together the chilli powder and turmeric with a splash of water to make a paste (this stops the turmeric burning), and then stir into the pan.
Add the coconut milk and heat through. When you are ready to serve add the chopped tomatoes and stir in the fish. Cook on a gentle heat for about 5 minutes until the fish is cooked through.
Check the seasoning then sprinkled with fresh chopped coriander and some with fragrant basmati rice.

A uniquely flavoured dish made from roasting a delicate blend of spices to form a thick paste with coconut and kashmiri chillies for an intense heat and delicious flavour.
Hari says
Chicken Xacuti is actually pronounced as shakuti. It's a unique South Indian dish from the Goan region that is made with poppy seeds and Kashmiri chillies. It's thought that 'shakuti' comes from the Portuguese dish 'chacuti' which has been modified and to produce this dish. 

It's a dish that is cooked with some typical South Indian flavours in a typical South Indian style. The chicken is first marinated and the spices roasted and ground to create a fragrant paste. It radiates a beautiful bright red colour which comes from the lovely kashmiri chillies that are a key ingredient of this dish. If you are the mood to wake up your taste buds then this is the dish for you. Hot, fiery and delicious.

Chicken Chaat
Tangy, tamarind flavoured shredded chicken.
Hari says
Chaat is a savoury snack - and Indians love a savoury snack. And this is why Indian food has blended so well with the British culture, as we love them too. Chaat is usually served at the roadside in India and is either vegetable or meat based, served with hot dry spices, sour tamarind sauce, fresh yoghurt and green coriander. There are so many different versions to play with, but they are all about awakening your taste buds with sharp, yet delicious, flavours.

Ingredients
4 chicken thighs, skinned and trimmed
3 cloves garlic
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, finely diced
2 green chillies, finely chopped
2-4 tbsp tamarind water, or juice from 1 lemon
1 tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp mango powder (amchoor)
Handful of fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Place chicken in a pan and cover with water, add the garlic cloves, salt and place on a gentle heat.
Cook for about 10 minutes and remove from the water and leave to cool. Retain the water as stock.
Heat the oil in a pan and add the onions, cook gently until browned.
Add the green chilli, salt to taste and pour in the tamarind water with a little of the stock water from the chicken.
Cook gently and let the sauce reduce. Add a little more stock and cook to thicken. After about 5 minutes add both the chilli and mango powders.
Once the chicken has cooled, shred it using two forks and add to the sauce.
Stir to coat and leave to cook for a few minutes.
Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the garam masala and a handful of fresh coriander.

Chicken Pathia
A traditional Parsi dish from the Gujarat region with a hot, sweet and sour sauce.
Hari says
This unique dish brings together the sweetness of the jaggery (Indian sugar made with sugar cane), the heat from the dried red chillies and the sharp, fresh sourness of vinegar to create a wonderful combination of flavours. I've heard this described as a gentle, Chinese-flavoured dish lifted with classic Indian spices. Which is about right. 
For this version, I'm adding star anise (which isn't typically Indian, I know) to add a gentle aniseed nuance to help make a great dish even better. You are putting your apron on now, aren't you...?!?

Ingredients
6 chicken thigh fillets, skinned, trimmed and cut into bite size pieces
Paste
125ml malt vinegar
2 tbsp jaggery, or brown sugar
1 heaped tsp cumin seeds
1-2 dried red chillies (use more if you like it hot)
2 cloves garlic
Sauce
1 tsp rapeseed oil
1 star anise
1 large onion, finely diced
1 tsp salt
Handful coriander, chopped

Method
Soak the dried chillies in boiling water to soften for 10 minutes.
Dissolve jaggery or brown sugar in half the vinegar and set to one side.
Pound the cumin seeds and soaked chillies in a pestle and mortar, then add the garlic to create a spice paste. Stir in one tablespoon of vinegar. You can blitz in a blender is you have one.
In a pan heat the oil and add the star anise. After a minute add the chopped onion and sauté until brown.
Add in the spice paste and cook for about 2-3 minutes.
Place the chicken pieces into the pan and stir fry in the paste for a few minutes.
Sprinkle in salt to taste and pour in the remaining vinegar. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes.
Add the jaggery and vinegar mixture and reduce the heat. Half cover the pan and stir occasionally. Cook for 10 minutes until the sauce is thick and sticky. The chicken should be cooked through and deliciously tender. You can add a little water if you wish.
Sprinkle with fresh coriander to serve.

Served with
This is a dry sticky sauce that works really well with some plain rice.

Sooka Masala Lamb
The lamb is left beautifully tender and amazingly fragrant cooked with dry roasted spices.
Hari says
This lamb is cooked in a masala sauce where the spices have been roasted making them fragrant and delicious. By applying heat to them in this way the spices become heady and more pungent creating a dish that is fuller in flavour. This combined with the final fry or 'bhun' gives this dish a depth that is wonderful.

So if you love your thick hearty curry sauces, then this is certainly one for you to try.

Ingredients
600g Leg of lamb, trimmed, washed & chopped into chunks
Spices to roast
2 tsp cumin seeds
4 tsp coriander seeds
2-4 dried whole red chillis
3cm stick of cassia bark
4 green cardamoms
3 cloves
Masala Sauce
4 tbsp oil
2 black cardamom 
2 large onions, finely chopped
5 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
2 tbsp ginger, grated
4 tomatoes, finely chopped
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt
Handful coriander, chopped

Method
To roast the spices place cumin, coriander, chillies, cassia, green cardamom, and cloves in frying pan and heat until they are fragrant and turn a shade darker. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool.
Place the spices into a grinder and blitz to a fine powder.
Coat the meat with the spice mix and set to one side.
Heat oil and add the black cardamom then add the chopped onion and garlic. Fry on a high heat and reduce and cook gently until they turn a dark golden brown colour.
Add the ginger, turmeric, tomatoes and stir. Allow the tomatoes and onions to melt together creating a thick masala paste.
Add the spiced meat and salt then fry for 5 minutes.
Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and place the lid on the pan. Leave it to cook in its own juices for 40-50 minutes stirring occasionally until the meat is soft and tender. 
When the meat is cooked through increase the heat and fry or 'bhun' for 5 minutes until the sauce thickens and starts to cling to the meat.
Throw in the chopped coriander to serve.

Coorg Pandi Curry
A full flavoured pork curry from Coorg in South India
Hari says
There are very few areas in India where pork is consumed but in the southern region of Coorg pork is considered a delicacy. This is a dish that shouldn't be rushed, instead it should be left to simmer away slowly in it's own juices allowing the natural flavours to come through. The final dish has an intense colour with a real deep rich flavour and the meat should be soft and succulent. Traditionally this is finished with some warming spices and a tart vinegar called 'kachampuli', it's only available in this region, but malt vinegar works just fine.

Ingredients
800g pork, cut into chunks
1 tsp salt
1 tsp peppercorns, crushed
1 tsp turmeric
4 medium onions, sliced
8 cloves of garlic, crushed 
1 tbsp oil
5cm piece ginger, sliced
3 level tbsp coriander powder
2 level tbsp chilli powder
1 tsp cumin seeds
½ tsp mustard seeds
2 tbsp malt vinegar

Method
Mix the sliced onions and crushed garlic with the pork and sprinkle with 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp crushed peppercorns, turmeric and set aside.
Heat 1 tbsp oil and add the ginger, carefully fry it until brown. Remove and add to the pork.
You have to work quickly here so you don't burn the spices. On very gentle heat add 3 level tbsp of crushed coriander seeds and stir for about 30 seconds. Then add 2 level tbsp of chilli powder and stir until it turns a reddish brown.
Add the pork and stir to coat all the meat. Cover the pan with a lid and leave to simmer gently for about 10 minutes - stir occasionally.
Add 1 cup of warm water and cook the meat uncovered on a medium heat until it's done (about 30-50 minutes).
Meanwhile, heat a small pan and add the cumin seeds and mustard seeds and roast until they become aromatic (1-2 minutes). Remove and grind to a powder and set to one side.
Once the pork is soft and tender add 1-2 tbsp vinegar and leave to cook gently for a further 10 minutes.
Taste the dish and adjust seasoning with salt and vinegar if required.
Stir in the roasted cumin and mustard seeds the serve with some plain rice.

Karahi Paneer
Vibrant dry fried dish of paneer cooked with peppers and fresh tomatoes
Hari says
Paneer is really versatile and yes it's a great meat substitute but it's also a delicious ingredient that is used widely across north India. This dish is almost an Indian stir fry dish using fresh tomatoes and the zingy fragrance of coriander seeds to create a full and flavoursome masala. Like most dry curry dishes this is cooked in a karahi which allows the heat to penetrate and flavour the ingredients right through. I like the peppers to remain crisp adding texture and colour. Let me know what you think below.

Print
Ingredients Method
400-600g Paneer, cubed
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 red onion, sliced
2 garlic cloves
3cm piece of ginger, thinly sliced into strips 
3 fresh tomatoes, chopped
1 tsp salt 
2 or 3 green chillies, sliced lengthways
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
½ tsp turmeric 
1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp black pepper
1 heaped tsp Kasoori methi
½ red pepper, cubed
½ green pepper, cubed
Handful of Coriander leaves, chopped
1 tsp garam masala

Method
Heat oil in a pan add the cumin seeds until the sizzle then add the ginger and garlic and give a quick fry.
Reduce the heat and add sliced onion and fry for a few minutes.
Add the chopped tomatoes and add the salt and slit green chillies. Increase the heat and leave to cook.
Once the tomatoes start to cook down, add the chilli powder, crushed coriander seeds, black pepper and turmeric. If you feel it is catching on the bottom of the pan, you can add a little water.
Fry until the tomatoes break down completely and you are left with a thick masala paste. Make sure the masala is nice and dry and thick.
Cut the paneer into cubes. If it is store-bought, you may want to soak the paneer in warm water to soften.
Add the peppers to the masala and stir. Cook for 1 or 2 minutes
Remove the paneer from the water and add to the pan.
Stir in the kasoori methi. Stir and reduce the heat and leave it to cook for about 5-6 minutes.
The masala should be thick and the paneer beautifully coated.
Add the chopped coriander and garam masala to serve.

Creamy paneer cooked in a delicious, velvety smooth, bright red butter sauce that is delicately spiced to give a uniquely flavoured dish. Finished with cream or butter for a bit more decadence!
Hari says
My friend made this for me recently and it was different to my version and I was intrigued by her sauce. I went through her recipe and we took the best bits of both our dishes and recreated it with our own new recipe. The sauce is thick, lusciously red and like velvet, the paneer has to be made fresh and left to solidify for at least an hour and then chopped into large cubes. The two parts are then brought together to produce this lovely dish. Once you have tried it with paneer why not add a few vegetables in as well.
To buy the main ingredients for my Makhani, check out my curry kit here.

Ingredients
400g paneer, diced
Tomato Sauce
2 medium red onion, roughly chopped
2-3 green chillies, roughly chopped
1 tsp ginger, grated
4 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
4cm stick of cassia bark
4 green cardamom pods
3 cloves
5 whole black peppercorns
7 ripe red tomatoes roughly chopped/400g tin plum tomatoes
Makhani Sauce
3 tbsp ghee
1 tbsp cumin
2 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tsp salt
1 tsp kasoori methi (fenugreek)
2-4 tbsp greek style yogurt or cream
1 cup hot water
1 tbsp honey 
knob of butter
Garnish
10ml cream
Handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped

Method
Put onion, ginger, garlic, chillies, green cardamom, black pepper, cassia bark, salt into a pan and cover with water (approx. 1L) and bring to the boil.
Add a tin of tomatoes to the pan and leave to simmer for 15-20 min on medium heat stirring occasionally.
After the sauce has reduced and the mixture has come to a thick saucy consistency remove it from heat. Let the mixture cool down remove the cassia bark and discard.
Blend to a fine sauce, for a very smooth sauce you can strain it through a sieve.
In a second pan heat the ghee and add the cumin seeds. As soon as they crackle stir in the tomato sauce very carefully.
Fry the sauce then stir in turmeric, Kashmiri chilli, crushed coriander, dried fenugreek and stir for 2-3 minutes. 
Once the sauce has thickened reduce the heat and stir in the yoghurt or cream, honey and butter.
Cook for a minute or two and add the fresh homemade paneer. Stir to coat with the sauce then leave to simmer for 5 minutes on a gentle heat. Add a little hot water to loosen the sauce if required and the honey.
Garnish with coriander leaves and top with a dash of cream before serving.

Paapri Chaat
Cooling indian salad or chaat made with chickpeas and a variety of chutneys to give a spicy, sweet and savoury dish.
Hari says
This is another mouth tingling dish and takes me back to childhood. I remember my mum being super excited about eating and making this and it wasn't long before I understood why.
I guess the best way to explain what a chaat is,is that it's a cooling Indian salad. It has a number of different elements all of which come together to make your mouth 'literally' sing.
I know this recipe looks really long and it seems to have lots of elements, but it's actually fairly simple. You can cheat if you want to and I won't hold it against you by buying the paapri (crisps) from an Indian grocery store. The result is a dish that is so full of flavour that it wakes up all your taste buds. It has elements that are sweet, sour and spicy, it has textures that are smooth, soft and crispy, it has a warming sensation from the chilli and a cooling feel from the yoghurt and mint.

Ingredients
Paapri
200g plain flour
40g oil
salt, to taste
1 tbsp ajwain seeds
Vegetable oil for frying
Green Chutney
Handful of coriander leaves
Handful of mint leaves
1 green chilli
5cm piece ginger
½ tsp black rock salt
Salt, to taste
½ tsp garam masala
Juice of 1 lemon
Sweet Yoghurt 
3 tbsp yogurt
3 tsp icing sugar
milk to loosen if required
Sweet Date and Tamarind Chutney
85g seedless tamarind
80g seedless dates
40g grated jaggery (or brown sugar)
450ml water
½ tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp cumin seeds, crushed
½ tsp dry ginger powder
½ tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp black salt, or rock salt
Spiced Chickpeas
1 green chilli, finely chopped
1x400g can of chickpeas
1 small red onion, finely diced
2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves
1 tsp roasted cumin powder
1 tsp chaat masala powder
¼ tsp red chilli powder (optional)
1 tsp black salt
salt to taste

Method
Paapri
Add the flour to a bowl and mix in the salt and ajwain.
Add the oil and start to knead to form a dough.
Make small balls with the dough slightly bigger than the size of a gooseberry.
Roll them out so they are about 4-5 cm in diameter. 
Place a large, deep pan or a wok on a gentle heat and pour in the vegetable oil and allow it to get hot.
To test if it's hot enough, drop a tiny piece of dough into the pan – if it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, it's ready.
Very gently slide in one circle of dough and fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Then using your spoon to push them under the oil, then carefully flip them over and continue cooking for 1 minute, until it's golden and crisp. Transfer to a kitchen paper to drain, and repeat with the remaining dough.
Green Chutney
Place all the ingredients, into a blender and blitz to make a chutney. Add a little water if required.
Sweet Date and Tamarind Chutney
Put the tamarind, dates and water into a pan and cook for about 10 mins on a gentle heat.
Add the jaggery and stir and let it come to a boil. Once the jaggery has dissolved the mixture will start to thicken. 
Stir in all the spices and salt and simmer for about 20-25 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool.
Sieve the chutney mixture into a blender and grind until the chutney is smooth. Add a little water if required. This will keep in a clean jar in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
Spiced Chickpeas
Open the chickpeas and place into a bowl. Using your hand squash them a little. 
Place them in a bowl and add all the other ingredients and mix to combine. taste and adjust if needed. 
To Serve
In a bowl add the chickpea mixture and crush some paapri's over the top. Add some blobs of sweetened yoghurt, some green chutney and some tamarind and date chutney and enjoy. Or place all the bowls on the table and let your guests help themselves.

Zafrani Pilau
Hari says
If you're looking for a way to jazz up your rice side dish for that posh dinner party, then this is the dish for you. It really isn't for those of you who may be worried about calories because this is all about adding a touch of luxury to the humble rice. This rice is creamy and buttery and has a bite to it with a warming fragrance and the sophistication of saffron. Yes, it's a bit posh, but it's oh-so-good.

Ingredients
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp salt
1 tsp butter
50ml cream
260g Basmati rice
Pinch of saffron 

Method
Wash the rice in two or three changes of water until the starch water runs clear. Then leave it to soak in warm water for 30 mins. Pre-heat the oven to 180ºC.
Boil 300ml water in the kettle and keep to one side.
In a wide based pan, add the oil and leave to heat up before adding the cumin seeds. Fry for 30 seconds until you can smell the cumin aroma and pour in the boiling water, salt, butter and cream.
Bring the water back to the boil, drain the rice and add it to the pan. Bring back to the boil. Leave to cook until the water has just been absorbed (about 6 minutes).
Remove from the heat and wet a clean tea towel. Cover the rice first with the wet tea towel and then with the lid of the pan.
Place the pan in the oven for 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, crush the saffron strand in a pestle and mortar and add to a little warm water. Leave to steep.
Remove the pan from the oven, remove the lid and the tea towel (be careful - it will be hot). Check the rice is cooked and then leave the rice to stand for a few minutes. If it's not cooked, leave in the oven for another couple of minutes.
Pour in streaks of the saffron water and very gently fork through the rice before serving.

Cabbage Thoran
A simple dry spiced cabbage dish
Hari says
Vegetarian Indian food is just delightful, so much so that when you eat a vegetarian Indian diet you just don't seem to miss the meat element at all. I think this is because we are not scared about adding big bold flavours to delicate vegetables. There are so many options when it comes to vegetables and there are so many different styles and regional dishes you can go for. 
In Kerela, 'Thoran' is a generic term used for a dry vegetable curry that can literally be made with any of the local, seasonal vegetables. Keralan cuisine is known to use a lot of green vegetables, such as snake beans, tindori or ivy berries. Unripe jack fruit is common, along with leafy greens as well. 
I had a request for a cabbage curry recently and being a cabbage lover (I mean I love it raw, sauteed in a bit of butter, boiled etc) I thought a Thorna would be perfect, so here you go...

Ingredients
3 tbsp coconut oil
2 tsp black mustard seeds
2 tbsp chopped, fresh curry leaves
1 tsp cumin seeds
2 dried Kashmiri chillies, each broken into smaller pieces
5cm ginger piece, finely grated
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt
½ tsp ground black pepper
250g cabbage, shredded
2 fresh green chillies, sliced
100g fresh coconut, grated

Method
Heat the oil in a large saucepan or karahi. When it is hot, add the mustard seeds followed by the curry leaves, cumin seeds and dried chillies.
Stir for about 30 seconds, then add the grated ginger, turmeric, salt and black pepper and fry for 30 seconds.
Stir in the cabbage and cook over a medium heat for 5-7 minutes. You may need to add a splash of water.
Once the cabbage is tender, stir in the green chillies and coconut. Heat through for a few minutes and serve.
Perfect with some fresh boiled rice.

Patra Ni Machi
Sea bass cooked with a fragrant green chutney all wrapped up in a banana leaf.
Hari says
This famous dish, created by the Parsi people from the Gujarat region, is usually served at weddings. Cooking and feeding your guests a dish like this is a truly wonderful experience for them as it’s so fresh, rustic and represents everything that’s great about Indian costal food.
The fish, usually something meaty, white, and with a delicate flesh (such as sea bass, never use a strong flavoured fish) is coated with a vibrant green chutney made from fragrant herbs, spices and coconut. This is then all packaged up in a banana leaf, which you can buy online or at most Indian or Thai supermarkets. This locks in the flavours, protects the fish and adds a certain charm to your dish when you cook it and when you serve it. Better than foil, put it like that. These beautiful little packages can be steamed but I prefer to pan fry them or cook them on the BBQ. Oh, and be sure to serve the fish directly in the leaf. It looks really cool!

Ingredients Method
4 seabass or pomfret steaks
100g fresh coconut, grated
3 green chillies
50g coriander, washed
50g mint leaves, washed
4cm piece of ginger
3 garlic cloves
½ tsp cumin powder
¼ tsp turmeric powder
½ tsp salt
1 lemon
1 large banana leaf washed thoroughly, central spine removed
1 tbsp vegetable oil

Method
Put the fish steaks on a tray and squeeze the lemon over them with a sprinkle of salt and turmeric.
Rub this over the fish and set to one side for 20 minutes.
Crush the cumin seeds. Put the coconut, green chillies, coriander and mint leaves, ginger and garlic, a little salt and the crushed cumin into a blender and grind to a smooth paste. And a dash of water if required.
Coat the pieces of fish all over and keep aside.
Pat dry the banana leaf pieces and smear lightly with a little oil on the smooth side.
Place one piece of fish in the center of each piece of leaf and wrap into a neat parcel. Tie with twine from the leaf or with a toothpick.
This can either be griddled or cooked in a steamer for 15 minutes. Serve it all wrapped up with a some rice.

Slow Cooked Lamb Shanks
Slow cooked lamb shank with a delicious masala gravy perfect for that special dinner party
Hari says
This is a dish that I cooked recently for my friends who were all expecting a curry but this was more special because is was full of all the right aromas and flavours but it looked like it had just come out of a 5 star kitchen at a restaurant. If you prefer a smooth sauce you can blitz it with a hand blender and strain it.
This is a really nice dish to dress up when you are showing off (well we all like to do it) at a dinner party.
It's a really hearty, slow cooked dish that is packed full of wonderful earthy flavours and it's not that difficult to cook either, it just needs a bit of time. The gravy oozes depth with lovely warming flavours and the meat just melts away. 
Top Tip:
If you haven’t got the time to make this in the evening, then you can slow cook it so it’s ready when you get in. Find out more here.

Ingredients
4 tbsp of vegetable oil
5cm stick of cassia bark
4 cardamom pods
6 cloves
3 onions, peeled and finely sliced
4 lamb shanks
4cm piece of ginger
5 garlic cloves
3 green chillies, chopped
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
4 tbsp of plain Greek yoghurt
4 tomatoes
½ tbsp of garam masala, powder
handful of coriander, leaves
salt to taste

Method
Make sure you have a large enough sauce pan to fit in all your lamb shanks. Heat the oil and add the lamb shanks and on a high heat to just brown the meat on all sides. Remove the shanks and set to one side.
Add the cassia, cardamom, and cloves and sauté until the spices become fragrant (just a minutes).
Add the sliced onions and cook over a medium heat, until they are golden brown.
Crush the ginger and garlic in a pestle and mortar and add to the pan along with the green chillies.
Stir well for a couple of minutes and then add the turmeric, chilli, cumin and coriander powders and salt.
Add the chopped tomato and stir leave to simmer for 5-10 minutes to create a thick masala paste.
Once the onions and tomatoes have melted into the sauce stir in the yoghurt a little at a time, until it has all melted into the sauce. 
Put the shanks back into the pan and coat with the masala. Reduce the heat and leave this to cook for about 30 minute.
Add hot water to cover the meat on the shanks and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cover with a lid.
Leave the meat to cook until the lamb is soft and coming away from the bone, approximately 3 hours. 
Check the seasoning and adjust if required. Sprinkle with garam masala and some chopped coriander leaves.

Dhum Aloo
A potato curry spiced with Kashmiri flavours
Hari says
Dhum refers to a style of cooking and not your intelligence level. So no this is not me being rude about the humble little potato infact this is me celebrating its versitility. Even if you have totally bare cupboards you would still be able to cook yourself a fragrant potato curry and with this is one thats a bit different from the usual Bombay potatoes.
This is a Kashmiri classic that's cooked in the traditional Kashmir style which involves deep frying the potatoes then sautéing them in Kashmiri spices such as asafetida, fennel and ginger powders and then leaving them to simmer in a yoghurt based sauce. It's a really great side dish that's a little bit different so do give it a go.

Ingredients
20 new potatoes
oil for deep-frying
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
5 tbsp greek yoghurt
5 green cardamom
1 tsp ginger powder
2 tbsp fennel seed, crushed
1 tbsp mustard oil
2 cloves, crushed
¼ tsp asafoetida
1 tsp salt
1 tsp garam masala
1 handful coriander, chopped

Method
Prick the potatoes all over with the help of a fork. Keep in salted water for fifteen minutes. Drain and wipe dry.
Heat oil in a karahi and deep-fry the potatoes on medium heat till golden brown. Drain on paper and set aside.
In a spice grinder grind 5 cardamoms and 1 tbsp fennel seed. Rewmove any husks if they do not grind to a powder. 
Whisk this with the yogurt and the Kashmiri red chilli powder and ginger powder.
Heat the mustard oil in a pan. Add the crushed cloves and asafoetida. Add half a cup of water and salt to taste and bring the mixture to a boil.
Stir in the yogurt mixture and bring the mixtuer to a boil.
Add the fried potatoes and cook gently until the potatoes absorb the gravy and the oil surfaces (about 20 minutes).
Garnished with garam masala powder and fresh coriander

A rustic Parsi, one pot lamb stew cooked with lentils, vegetables, tamarind and spices making a hot, sweet and sour dish.
Hari says
This Parsi dish is basically a rustic, one-pot lamb stew cooked with lentils, vegetables, tamarind and spices (the 'dhan' means grain or lentils and the 'sak' is to stew). And it’s smashing.
It’s typically eaten with the whole family as a weekend meal, and you can see why. It has tang from the tamarind, heat from the chillies and sweetness from the vegetables that all come together creating a pretty special balance of flavours. Something for everyone, really. 
Top Tip:
If you haven’t got the time to make this in the evening, then you can slow cook it so it’s ready when you get in.

Ingredients
500g leg of lamb, trimmed and cut into chunks
Lentil and vegetable mixture
60g toor dhal split
60g masoor dhal split
60g urid dhal split
1 small aubergine, chopped into large chunks
½ small pumpkin, chopped into large chunks (you could also use butternut squash or sweet potato)
1 medium onion, chopped in chunks
15 fresh mint leaves, chopped
Dry Spices
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp coriander seeds
4cm stick cassia bark
4 green cardamoms
4 whole black peppercorns
1 tbsp dry fenugreek leaves
Wet Paste
6 cloves garlic
3cm piece of ginger
2 chillies
Masala
2 tbsp oil
2 medium onions, diced
3 tomatoes, diced
1 tsp salt
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tbsp tamarind paste
Handful of coriander, chopped

Method
Lentil and vegetable mixture
Put all the lentils, vegetables, onions and mint into a pan with 1L of water and some salt. Bring this to the boil and leave to simmer for 20 minutes until the lentils have cooked through.
Dry spices and Wet paste
Place all the dry spices into a spice grinder and blend to a fine powder.
Place this powder into a blender with the garlic, ginger and chillies and grind to make an aromatic paste. Add a splash of water to loosen if required.
Masala
Heat the oil and start to fry the diced onions until they are golden brown (approx. 20 minutes).
Once the onions are browned add the spice paste along with the turmeric and fry for a few minutes until golden.
Add the tomatoes and tamarind then stir for about 5 minutes until the masala is thick and glossy.
On a high heat, stir in the lamb and coat with the masala. After about 5 minutes add the cooked lentil mixture and leave this to simmer on a low heat for about 30-40 minutes. Make sure you stir occasionally as this can catch the bottom of the pan.
Once the meat is tender check the seasoning and adjust if required.
Throw in the fresh coriander to serve.

Lamb with Spinach
Tender lamb delicately spiced with coriander seeds in a creamy yoghurt sauce cooked with fresh spinach
Hari says
Although I love deep, dark, rich lamb dishes this one is much lighter in flavour but the depth is still there. A delicious way to get some greens into your diet which not only tastes great but looks amazing too. 
Make sure you very gently let the yoghurt absorb into the dish as the last think you want is for this to split the sauce. Make sure you use full fat yoghurt for this but if you are on a health kick then it's fine to leave it out completely.

Ingredients
900g lamb leg, trimmed and cubed
Marinade
6 cloves of garlic
3-4cm ginger, roughly chopped
2 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp salt
Masala
3 tbsp oil
2 large onions, sliced into rings
salt to taste
1 tsp turmeric
1 red chilli, chopped
1 tsp chilli powder (optional)
4 tbsp yoghurt
300g fresh spinach, washed and thinly sliced

Method
Put the coriander seeds into the pestle and mortar and crush.
Add the ginger, garlic and salt then crush everything to a paste.
In a bowl add the paste to the meat and leave for 20-30 minutes.
Heat oil and add the onions and begin to cook until golden brown. Remove one-third and set on kitchen roll for later.
To the remaining onions add the marinated meat and stir in the turmeric, salt, chopped chilli and chilli. Turn the heat up and fry for 2-3 minutes.
Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and place the lid on the pan and cook for 15 minutes stirring occasionally.
Into the meat stir in one tablespoon of the yoghurt until it has all been absorbed then repeat with the remaining yoghurt one spoonful at a time.
Add the spinach (retaining a little for the garnish) and stir, cover the pan and leave to cook for 40 minutes. Stir occasionally and cook until the lamb is delicious and tender. The sauce should be thick and creamy with the spinach entwined and clinging to the meat.
Chop up the browned onions and a little fresh spinach to sprinkle on top and serve.

Tangy Fried Okra
A simply heavenly vegetarian dish cooked with fried onion, fragrant crushed coriander seeds and spicy chilli, then finished with a dusting of zingy mango.
Hari says
There are many different ways of cooking okra or ladyfingers.
This is the okra dish that my mum cooked for my dad as a simple, quick flash in the pan dish.
It is delicious and makes a great side accompaniment to any Indian meal.
My brother has always been a fan of okra and I'm hoping that just quoting his words will make you want to give this dish a go.
Simply this is "food of the gods".

Ingredients
500g okra
3 tbsp mustard oil
1 onion, finely sliced
2 tsp coriander seeds
1 dried red chilli/1tsp chilli flakes
1 tsp salt
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp garam masala
2 tsp amchoor powder (dried mango powder)

Method
Wash and thoroughly dry the okra (kitchen roll is great for this). 
Remove the tops and slice the okra in half lengthways. Place the coriander seeds and red chilli into the pestle and mortar and pound until you have a coarse powder, then leave to one side.
Heat the oil in a wok or non-stick pan on a medium heat, then stir in the sliced onions and cook until they just begin to brown.
Add the okra and fry for about ten minutes, stirring now and then.
Add the salt, turmeric along with the coriander and chilli mixture. Reduce the heat and leave the okra to cook for five more minutes (do not cover the pan).
Once cooked, remove from the heat, sprinkle with garam masala and dust with the armchoor powder to serve.

Served with
I like to have my okra fairly crisp but if you prefer them slightly more soft continue to cook them for a little longer. These make a great accompaniment to any saucy dish and add a lovey contrast.

If you are like me and have spice cravings then try them on toast with a little yoghurt - you won't be disappointed.

Turnip Chana Dhal Save
A homely lentil dhal dish cooked with seasonal turnips.
Hari says
A wonderful dhal dish that is cooked with split chickpeas which are know as chana dhal. These lentils do take a bit of cooking so its best to soak them before hand and cook them in a pressure cooker. If you do not have a pressure cooker then it can take a couple of hours to cook through, alternatively you can use a slow cooker too.
The turnip add a lovely texture to the dish and this is delicious to make in the winter months when you are looking for something warm and comforting.

Ingredients
4 small turnips
125g Chana Dal 
1 small onion, sliced
2 cloves of garlic, sliced
3 ripe tomatoes 
1 or 2 green chillies
4cm piece of ginger
1 tbsp oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
4 cm piece cassia bark
1 tsp mustard seeds 
1 tsp coriander seeds
½ tsp red chilli powder 
½ turmeric powder 
1tsp or to taste salt 
handful fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Clean the chana dal and soak it in water for 3-4 hours before hand.
Peel, wash and cut turnips into small pieces.
Put the soaked dal and turnip pieces into a prerssure cooker, add 2 cups water, salt and then close the cooker and begin to heat.
After the first whistle reduce the heat and leave it to simmer about 4 minutes, then remove from the heat. Leave to cook and DO NOT open until the pressure has been releases.
Meanwhile roughly chop the tomatoes and chillies and ginger.
Place the cumin, mustard and coriander seeds in a frying pan and roast until they turn a shade darker and become frgrant. Crush the spices in a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder.
Then put the tomatoes, green chillies, ginger into a blender to make a fine paste.
Heat oil in a frying pan and add the cumin and cassia. Once fragrant add the sliced onions and garlic until they just start to brown.
Stir in the turmeric powder, salt and ground spices once this becomes fragrant stir in the tomato mixture and leave to cook until you have a thick masala sauce. 
Open the cooker, and check the dhal is well cooked by squeezing the chana between your fingers. If they are cooked stir in the masala sauce into the dhal.
If you want to loosen it a little add enough hot water to get the consistency you want.
Add the chopped coriander and garnish with a little butter.

Black Lentil and Split Chickpea Dhal
A thick whole black lentil and split chickpea mixed dhal.
Hari says
This thick lentil dhal has a creamy texture, and it’s made from a simple mixture of black lentils (also called Urid beans) and split chickpeas.
This combination gives it a wholesome earthiness, and the little yellow freckles throughout the dish look beautiful, too. Do experiment with different lentils though. They might seem dull little things but if you cook them right they release a range of textures, and when combined with some aromatic Indian spices they taste simply stunning. They are a healthy option, easy to make and make a nice change.
You should be able to find any of these lentils at Indian grocery shops but if you can't, look online or write to me and I’ll help you find some.

Ingredients
Lentils
100g split chickpeas (chana)
100g urid beans, washed and checked for stones
1L water
1 tsp salt
Masala 
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 small onion
1 clove garlic, chopped
½ tin or 200g tomatoes
1 tsp ginger, grated
1 chilli, finely chopped
1 tsp turmeric
½ tsp salt
1 tsp garam masala
Handful of fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Lentils
Put the lentils in the pressure cooker and add 1L of cold water.
Add 1 tsp of salt put the lid on the pan and bring to the boil. Let the pan come to temperature and whistle once, then reduce the heat and leave to simmer for 30 minutes. After this time remove from the heat and leave the pan to cool - DO NOT REMOVE THE LID.
Masala
Meanwhile in a medium sized pan heat oil and add the onion and garlic, fry until lightly browned.
Reduce heat and add tomatoes, ginger, chilli, turmeric and ½ tsp of salt. Continue to cook so the tomatoes and onion have melted together to create a thick paste.
Once the pressure cooker has cooled and the pressure has been released open the lid. Check the lentils are cooked by squeezing them between your fingers. If they are soft they are ready.
Add the cooked dhal to the masala and stir, leave to cook for about 5 minutes.
Stir in the garam masala and throw in the coriander to serve.

Dhal Makhani
A true Punjabi dhal, earthy and wholesome, made with black lentils and kidney beans in a wonderfully rich, buttery sauce.
Hari says
An old school dhal made with black lentils and kidney beans.
Traditionally, this would be cooked slowly for hours to create the thick buttery consistency it's famous for.
This dhal is poor man's food, yet it is rich in protein and I think is really simple food at its best.
Now this style of slow cooking doesn't always work in the western world, so I speed up the process by soaking the beans and lentils overnight and then use a pressure cooker.
You still get the buttery consistency you want, yet unlike the restaurant version I don't add buckets of cream (but I make up for this with a good chunk of butter!). 
To buy the main ingredients for my Makhani, check out my curry kit here.
Top Tip:
If you haven’t got the time to make this in the evening, then you can slow cook it so it’s ready when you get in. Find out more here.

Ingredients
Lentils
100g dry urid dhal (whole black lentils)
25g dry rajma (kidney beans)
Masala 
1-2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
2 medium sized onions, finely chopped
3cm piece ginger, crushed
3 garlic cloves, crushed
3 fresh tomatoes, puréed
2 green chillies, slit in ½
½ tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp chilli powder
2 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
1 tsp of garam masala
1 tsp dried fenugreek leaf (kasoori methi)
Salt to taste
1-2 tbsp butter
Handful fresh coriander leaves, chopped

Method
Clean, wash and soak the black lentils and kidney beans separately, overnight.
Drain and keep aside. Combine the two dhals and add 2 cups of water with a little salt and put into a pressure cooker and cook for about 25 minutes until they are cooked and soft. (DO NOT REMOVE the lid of the pressure cooker until fully cooled and pressure has been released.)
Heat the oil in a pan and add cumin seeds.
When the cumin seeds crackle, add chopped onions and garlic.
Fry the onion until golden brown over a medium flame.

Cook for a few minutes so the onions and tomatoes melt together.
Add the cooked dhal and 1 cup of water and season with a little salt to taste.
Leave to simmer for 15 minutes until it is lovely and thick. (Take care as it may catch on the bottom of the pan.)
Stir in the butter, garam masala and fenugreek to make the dhal rich and delicious.
Garnish with a sprinkle of fresh coriander and serve.

Turnip Chana Dhal
A homely lentil dhal dish cooked with seasonal turnips.
Hari says
A wonderful dhal dish that is cooked with split chickpeas which are know as chana dhal. These lentils do take a bit of cooking so its best to soak them before hand and cook them in a pressure cooker. If you do not have a pressure cooker then it can take a couple of hours to cook through, alternatively you can use a slow cooker too.
The turnip add a lovely texture to the dish and this is delicious to make in the winter months when you are looking for something warm and comforting.

Ingredients
4 small turnips
125g Chana Dal 
1 small onion, sliced
2 cloves of garlic, sliced
3 ripe tomatoes 
1 or 2 green chillies
4cm piece of ginger
1 tbsp oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
4 cm piece cassia bark
1 tsp mustard seeds 
1 tsp coriander seeds
½ tsp red chilli powder 
½ turmeric powder 
1tsp or to taste salt 
handful fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Clean the chana dal and soak it in water for 3-4 hours before hand.
Peel, wash and cut turnips into small pieces.
Put the soaked dal and turnip pieces into a prerssure cooker, add 2 cups water, salt and then close the cooker and begin to heat.
After the first whistle reduce the heat and leave it to simmer about 4 minutes, then remove from the heat. Leave to cook and DO NOT open until the pressure has been releases.
Meanwhile roughly chop the tomatoes and chillies and ginger.
Place the cumin, mustard and coriander seeds in a frying pan and roast until they turn a shade darker and become frgrant. Crush the spices in a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder.
Then put the tomatoes, green chillies, ginger into a blender to make a fine paste.
Heat oil in a frying pan and add the cumin and cassia. Once fragrant add the sliced onions and garlic until they just start to brown.
Stir in the turmeric powder, salt and ground spices once this becomes fragrant stir in the tomato mixture and leave to cook until you have a thick masala sauce. 
Open the cooker, and check the dhal is well cooked by squeezing the chana between your fingers. If they are cooked stir in the masala sauce into the dhal.
If you want to loosen it a little add enough hot water to get the consistency you want.
Add the chopped coriander and garnish with a little butter.

Brown Lentil Dhal
A rustic wholesome brown lentil dhal with a nutty texture and an earthy flavour
Hari says
I have vivid memories of my mum cooking this dish using the dreaded pressure cooker, which incidentally I am sure would never have got past any health and safety checks today.
The tears of terror when that thing hissed to temperature and then released its pressure still fills me with dread.
But the memory is followed very quickly by the aroma of this whole brown dhal, with a swirl of melting butter in the middle of the bowl and my puffed up roti to dip into it take me right back to some good times! 
It's really important that lentils and beans are cooked properly to get rid of their naturally occurring toxins and anti-nutrients.
Whole lentils will take longer to cook, some require soaking overnight, some need to be cooked in a pressure cooker, unless you want to while away 4 or 5 hours watching them boil. 
The pressure cooker seems to be having a bit of a revival at the moment which is very exciting (I love pressure cooking or is that cooking under pressure?) anyway.
Trends are changing and we are beginning to realise that it's a healthy cooking method that locks in vitamins and minerals as well as significantly reducing cooking time.
Gone are the days when you would be able to open it too early and end up with food all over the ceiling (yes that did really happen).
These days they tend to have automatic lid locks and spring-loaded safety valves - how very posh!

Ingredients
Lentils
200g brown lentils
Approx. 1L of water
Masala
2 tbsp butter/ghee/vegetable oil
½ onion, chopped
200g/½ tin of tomatoes
1 tsp ginger, finely chopped
1 tsp salt
1 chilli, finely chopped
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp garam masala
Handful of coriander, chopped

Method
Place the lentils in the pressure cooker with about 700ml of cold water and one tsp salt.
Put the lid on the pan and secure it as instructed. Bring to the boil and allow the cooker to whistle three times.
Reduce heat and leave it to simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to cool - DO NOT REMOVE THE LID.
In a frying pan heat the butter and add the onions and fry until lightly browned. Reduce the heat and add the tomatoes, ginger, chilli, turmeric and cook down so the tomatoes and onions melt, creating a thick masala paste. This will take about 10 minutes.
Ensure the steam has been released from the pressure cooker and open the lid.
Check the dhal is cooked by squeezing some lentils between your fingers. If they are still hard check the water level (add a little more if required) and re-place lid on the cooker and repeat as per step 2. Once the lentils are soft they are ready.
Add the masala paste to the cooked dhal and cook together for a few minutes.
Sprinkle in the garam masala and coriander to serve.

Pomegranate Raita
A very special refreshing little side dish
Hari says
Most Indian meals are incomplete with the cooling element of yoghurt. You can just have plain yoghurt or create something more extravagant. There are so many different types of raita dishes and you can flavour yoghurt with pretty much anything. Some of the more usual ones are made with mint, cucumber or spices such as cumin seeds. I like this raita because the dish is slightly different and uses the wonderful pomegranate fruit. The little gems pop in your mouth releasing that lovely sweet flavoured fruit twang which is lovely with

Homemade Yoghurt
Creamy, homemade plain yoghurt.
Hari says
Making yoghurt at home with my mum brings back all kinds of childhood memory and kitchen smells for me.
I would watch my mum boil the milk and pour it into her old cracked brown clay pot (I must see if she still has that).
I would quite often be made to run over the road to our friends house to ask if they had any 'old yoghurt' we could use to start the new yoghurt off with.
She would then stir it into the warm milk and very delicately wrap the pot in a dark blue woollen blanket which had swirls of red running through the fibres.
Very carefully it would be placed it in cardboard box that was then moved into it's occasional home under the stairs.
Mum would then spend a good 10 minutes telling the three of us in no uncertain terms that if we knocked it over we were in for it.
The fun bit was alway the unveiling, had it worked? would it be nice an thick? Mum would always seem to be a bit nervous as she took the lid off but every time it had set and looked creamy and delicious.
Making your own yoghurt is one of those things that makes you feel good - it's healthy, it saves you money, it's simple, tastes good and is fun.
All you need is a pot with a heavy lid, and some 'old' yoghurt. I like to use full fat milk but you can use skimmed, or long-life too. One pint of milk will give you about 400g of yoghurt.

Print
Ingredients Method
1 pint full fat milk
1 tbsp natural plain yoghurt

Method
Place 1 pint of milk into a large wide based saucepan and bring it to the boil. Make sure to stir it so it doesn't scorch.
Removed from the heat and pour into a large terracota pot with a lid. Leave it to cool until it's just warm enough to touch (about 49°C). Stir it every now and again so prevent a skin forming.
Once cool enough stir in a heaped teaspoon of natural plain yoghurt until it has dissolved.
Place the lid on the pot and wrap the pot with a warm blanket.
Leave this in a warm place overnight to set.
Refrigerate before you eat it.

Home made curd cheese with a slight chewy texture and a little squeaky. It takes on the flavours of the ingredients it is put with.
Hari says
I love making paneer at home. It's so much nicer than the stuff in plastic vac packs you can buy off the supermarket shelves. Paneer is Indian cottage cheese. This is not only a substitute for meat, but is a very important ingredient in it's own right. Paneer is very much about the texture and doesn't really have a strong flavour of it's own. Like soya or tofu, it takes on the flavour of the sauce it is in. 
It is very easy to make and is the kind of cooking that makes you feel a bit like an earth mother - makes you feel good about yourself. It can either be used as small blocks which are deep fried and added to a sauce, not fried and added to vegetable dishes, marinated and grilled or crumbled into masala sauces. 
Dishes such as palak paneer (spinach and paneer) or paneer makhani (paneer in a creamy sauce) or muttar paneer (peas and paneers or cheesy peas!) have made this ingredient famous throughout UK restaurants. I recently found out (to my horror) that a number of Indian restaurants no longer serve paneer in these dishes and substitute it for cheddar cheese? How is this the same? Well in my opinion its not, so a word of advice - ask before you order.

Ingredients
2 pints (1.25L) full fat milk
2½ tbsp lemon juice/white vinegar

Method
Pour the milk into a non-stick pan and heat.
Just before the milk comes to a boil and as it starts to bubble add the lemon juice or vinegar and stir. Remove from the heat and stir then leave to stand for 5 minutes.
The milk will separate into solid curd and the watery liquid or whey.
If it hasn't separated you may need to add a little more vinegar. 
Line a colander with muslin or cheesecloth.
Scoop the curd into the lined colander (you can save the whey as stock).
Pull the cloth into a ball and when cool enough to handle squeeze out any excess liquid.
if you want to use the paneer to crumble into a sauce then just leave to hang.
If you want to cut the curd into chunks and add to a sauce then you need to make it more compact by placing a weight on to the muslin and leaving it to strain for at least an hour, but the longer the better.
The paneer can then be cut into cubes and fried or crumbled into a sauce.

Served with
This can be added to a tomato sauce, you can tandoori it, add it to a veg sauce or a butter sauce.
You can also flavour the paneer by adding in pepper, chilli flakes, coriander, cumin seeds into the milk before you add the vinegar.

Ghee
Hari says
Beautiful, nutty and so very aromatic, ghee is simply clarified butter (all the impurities are removed through a gentle heating process). Now, it might look pure and golden but ghee is saturated fat so only use it sparingly for rich, decadent dishes, such as kormas and biriyanis. It does have a pretty special flavour though and it adds something simply amazing to Indian food. It’s super easy to make, too, and most of the bigger supermarkets sell it.
Another nice thing about ghee is that it doesn't need to be refrigerated as all the milk proteins have been removed, so it won't go off. You can just leave it on your work top and it will solidify when it's cold and become a golden liquid at room temperature. Remember to always use a clean spoon and don’t contaminated it with water or other food and it will keep just for up to a year.

Ingredients
4 blocks of unsalted butter (gives approx. 500g ghee)

Method
Gently melt unsalted butter over low heat until the butter melts. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for about 15-20 minutes.
Whilst cooking start to carefully skim off the top layer of white froth using a spoon. These are the whey proteins which need to be removed.
When the butter stops producing this white foam on the surface and the milk sediment begins to stick to the bottom of the pan remove from the heat and leave to settle.
Once cooled, strain the mixture through a fine sieve or a cheesecloth-lined strainer. Try to keep the solids in the pan.
The liquid collected is the clarified butter (butterfat) that can be covered and stored for up to 12 months. There is no need to refrigerate ghee as there is no risk of it going rancid.

Served with
Use for those dishes that require a little bit more decadence. Gives a wonderful nutty flavour and warming aroma.

Paneer Pakora
Crisp golden paneer cooked with a selection of spices in a gram flour batter, which is deep fried.
Hari says
Pakoras are one of India's most infamous snack dishes. Usually, they are a mixture of different vegetables all bound together with spices and gram flour. This style of pakora is a little simpler and more along the lines of a Japanese tempura dish, but still uses gram flour. 
This was the pakora of choice for all kids when I was growing up. These golden discs of potatoes dipped into batter and fried were just amazing. The only thing that made them better (dare I say it) was smothering them in Heinz ketchup. Well, I was five! We would leave the mixed veg, spinach and chilli ones for the grown ups and feast on these.
Turning this into a slightly more adult version, I have cut out the ketchup and added a tang with some chaat masala. Don't just take my word for it, give it a go #tasty!  
To get the main ingredients for my Pakora recipe, check our my curry kit here.

Ingredients
120g paneer sliced into rectangles about 2cm wide. 14-16 slices
2 tbsp yoghurt, whisked
4 tbsp corn flour
2cm fresh ginger
1 green chilli
½ tsp salt
1 tbsp coriander, chopped
For Batter
100g gram flour
1 tsp  cumin seeds
1 tsp salt
Pinch of baking soda
Water 
To Serve
1 tsp chaat masala

Method
Marinade
Mince the green chilli and ginger in a blender.
In a mixing bowl, combine the yoghurt, corn flour, salt, ginger, green paste and coriander. Mix all together until you get a paste.
Add the paneer and coat with the yoghurt mixture. Set aside for one hour or more.
For Batter
Heat a little oil in a small pan to deep fry the pakora on a gentle heat.
In a second bowl, mix the gram flour, cumin seeds, salt and baking soda.
Add water slowly to make a thick  batter.
To test that the oil is hot enough, put one drop of batter in the oil. The batter should form a small ball, sink and rise to the surface, but not change colour too much.
Dip a marinated paneer slice into the batter so it is fully coated. Very carefully, slide it into the hot oil to start cooking. The pakoras will take about four to five minutes to cook. Turn it occasionally, until both sides are golden brown.
Repeat with the remaining pakora in small batches. The pakora should be light and crisp. They are delicious when served with a sprinkle of chaat masala and a chutney.

Served with
Delicious when served as a starter or a nibble with imlee, which is a tamarind-based chutney. My children love these with just some plain old tomato ketchup to dunk into.

A fresh and deliciously fiery, tangy mint chutney made with mint leaves, lemon and onion and chilli.
Hari says
This is the first thing my mum had me making - from sending me out to the garden to pick the fresh mint leaves to pounding the mint and onions. I can still feel the tears from the onions being crushed. Today with my whizzy hand blender it takes 30 seconds to make. It is so simple and I cannot recommend it highly enough - it is so fresh and zingy that your whole mouth will be tingling with excitement and each mouth full will make you want more. A great accompaniment to any snack you can even cool it down by stirring in some yoghurt. Once you try it - I promise you this is something you will be making over and over again.

Ingredients
Large bunch of fresh mint leaves
1 onion cut into chunks
1 tsp salt
1 green chilli (add more for more heat)
1 or 2 lemons

Method
Slice the lemon in half and slice off the rind, remove any pips and chop the flesh into quarters.
Remove the leaves from the mint, discarding the stalks and remove the chilli stems too.  
Place the mint, lemon, salt, chillies and onion into a blender and blitz until you get a fine blended chutney.

Served with
This is a fantastic fresh mint chutney that takes seconds to make and works well as a dip with all types of nibbles. This is the most fantastic zingy chutney you will ever taste!

Beetroot Chutney
Hari says
This is a lovely way to use beetroot.
It's a simple and vibrant sauce that is super easy to make.
The sweetness from the beetroot works so beautifully with the delicate cumin and warming ginger and chilli.
To top that, the gorgeous colour looks simply amazing too. 

Ingredients
1 beetroot
½ tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp chana dhal
1 tsp urid dhal
8 curry leaves
3 garlic cloves
2 tsp oil
½ tsp mustard seeds
½ tsp chilli powder

Method
Peel the skin off the beetroot and chop into small cubes.
In a pan, add oil and throw in the cumin seeds, red chilli, garlic, curry leaves, channa dal and urad dal.
Saute on a gentle flame until the lentils turn a golden colour. Empty into a bowl and set to one side.
Add a little oil and add the chopped beetroot and saute gently. Be careful as it can burn very easily. Add more oil if needed.
Cook for about 10 minutes until it is soft and then allow it to cool.
Put the beetroot and the fried spice mix into a blender and grind to a fine paste.
Heat oil in a pan and add the mustard seeds. Once they splutter, remove from the heat and pour into the ground chutney. Stir and transfer to a serving bowl.

This is a hot and warming chutney that's perfect for any snack (especially when it's cold)
Hari says
Chutneys are great to awaken the senses and this dish does not fail on that front.
It is brimming with the warming freshness that can only come from root ginger and the delicious mouth tingling hit you only get from hot birds eye chillies (which if you are not used to I would recommend you reduce the number used to 1 or 2).
I find this is the perfect accompaniment to potato starters such as aloo tikki just because potatoes and ginger seem to have a partnership that really works together.
This style of chutney is very much an Andhra style of cooking where toasting lentils in the preperation gives a lovely texture along with the usual hot, sweet, sour balance that runs through many Indian chutney dishes.

Ingredients
1 tbsp coconut oil
100g root ginger
1 heaped tsp urid dhal
10 dried birds eye chillies (use less to reduce the heat)
4 tbsp tamarind paste
1 heaped tsp jaggery (or brown sugar)
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 tsp salt (or to taste)
1 tsp cumin seeds
10 curry leaves

Method
Wash the fresh ginger to remove any grit and slice into chunks.
Heat just under one tbsp of coconut oil and add the urid dhal along with the dried chillies. Saute for 30 seconds until the dhal roasts and changes to a red gold colour. 
Add the ginger and cook for five to six minutes until it has softened a little.
Remove from the heat and stir in the tamarind.
Let the mixture cool for a few minutes and pour into a blender with the salt, jaggery, and grind to a paste. You may need to add a little water to loosen the mixture.
Add the remaining oil to a pan and heat before adding the mustard and cumin seeds. Once fragrant add the curry leaves.
Put the blended ginger paste back into the pan and cook for a minute or two.
Store in an air-tight container and keep refrigerated. This will keep for four to six weeks.

A lovely chutney of spiced chunky courgette.
Hari says
I love cookin chutneys and experimenting with hot, sour and sweet flavours is so much fun. For me, a good chutney has to have a balance of strong flavours, a chilli kick to awaken the tastebuds and a twang of sweetness too.
I made this chutney one year when I was drowning in fresh courgettes from the allotment and had no idea what to do with them. This recipe works amazingly well with marrows too, so now there is no reason to say you have no idea what to do with a marrow.
This is a lovely warming, chunky chutney that's great with cheese as well as curry. It keeps for a good four to six weeks once opened, so it makes a really lovely personal gift for friends.

Ingredients
1 tsp vegetable oil
1 heaped tsp kalonji seeds
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
2 dried kashmiri red chillies
200ml vinegar
200g jaggery or brown sugar
3 courgettes or 1.5kg marrow, chopped into chunks
1 red chilli, chopped
4 cloves of garlic, sliced
20g ginger, sliced
2 onions, sliced
1 tsp salt, or to taste
1 tsp chilli powder, optional

Method
Heat the oil in a heavy pan and add the cumin, mustard, kalonji, dried chillies until they sizzle and become fragrant - this should only take a minute.
Add the onions, sliced garlic, ginger, chilli, vinegar, jaggery (or sugar), chopped courgette (or marrow) and bring to a boil then leave to simmer stirring occassionally until it gets to a thick consistency (about 45 minutes).
Season with salt and chilli powder then stir to keep it from sticking. 
Put the chutney into a sterilised glass or pickling jar and leave to cool.
Once cooled seal the jar and the chutney will keep for 4-6 weeks. Refrigerate once opened.

Served with
Serve with a chunk of fresh bread and cheese or as a condiment for your favourite curry.

Juicy, succulent little spice bombs bursting with flavour in a soupy tomato sauce.
Hari says
Kofta are subtly spiced lamb balls, fried and then added to a full-flavoured, thick tomato sauce. If you think Swedish meatballs are good then these are going to blow your mind.
There are many different varieties of Kofta from those made with meat to lentils to paneer, but they’re all pretty tasty.
I love to cook this with the children and they in turn LOVE getting their hands in the bowl to make up the Kofta. The sauce can be made nice and thick or you can make it thinner by adding a dash of hot water. A fun, tasty, easy meal. Give it a go.

Ingredients
Kofta
400g mince lamb
2 tbsp oil
1 tsp salt
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
1 tsp chilli powder
2 tsp garam masala
Masala Sauce
1 tbsp oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
2-3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
2 tsp ginger, grated (3-4cm)
1 tsp salt
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves
1 chilli, chopped
½ tsp chilli powder
200g or ½ tin of plum tomatoes
1 tsp garam masala
Handful fresh coriander, finely chopped

Method
In a large mixing bowl add the mince lamb, salt, cumin, chilli powder, garam masala, and mix using your hands to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.
Rub a little oil on to your hands to stop the mixture sticking to your hands.
Take a small amount of the meat and roll in your palms to make a meatball. Ensure it is smooth all over and set to one side.
Repeat with the rest of the mixture.
Heat the oil in a frying pan. Carefully fry the meatballs (kofta) in batches so they brown and crisp up all over.
Remove the kofta using a slotted spoon and set them on some kitchen paper to drain.
Heat the oil in a pan and stir in the onions and garlic and gently cook down until the onions turn a dark golden brown colour.
Reduce the heat and add the ginger and chopped chilli, stir and add the tomatoes, salt, turmeric, fenugreek and chilli powder.
Stir together and leave to cook gently so the onions and tomatoes melt together with the spices creating a wonderfully thick aromatic paste.
Add the kofta to the pan and coat with the sauce for a few minutes.
Add enough boiling water to get the consistency of sauce you want. Bring it all to the boil and turn the heat off.
Leave the kofta to absorb the juices from the sauce for 5-10 minutes.
Throw in the garam masala and corinander before serving.

The best Indian street food available. These are crispy, tangy, hot, spicy and refreshing all in one go!
Hari says
Indian street food is awesome. It's all about quick easy snacks that are so packed full of flavour you just can't help going back for more. Gol Guppa as we call them in the Punjab or Pani Puri as they are known everywhere else are little spice bombs that deliver a taste sensation that I just can't describe - It's like nothing else you will have tasted before!

Buying these from a street vendor and watching my mum eat them with her sisters on a hot dusty street in India is probably one of my first memories. She was so excited and now I know why.....they are amazing and they are so different from any form of English food. 

These are about tantalising all your senses from the crispy crunch of the outer shell to the spiced mint green water that floods your mouth and undoubtedly dribbles down your chin (so make sure you have a napkin to hand) to the soft delicately flavoured chickpeas. I have nothing more to say you just have to experience the joy that is the Gol Guppa because it's delicious.

Ingredients Method
Puri
200g fine semolina
4 tbsp plain flour, plus some for dusting
Salt, pinch
Black pepper, pinch
130ml soda water
Vegetable oil for frying
Green Water
125ml tamarind pulp
2 tbsp roasted cumin seeds, crushed
50g coriander leaves, (small handful)
3 green chillies
80g mint leaves, (large handful)
1 tbsp black salt
2 tbsp jaggary, crushed
450ml water
Sweet Date and Tamarind Chutney
85g seedless tamarind
80g seedless dates
40g grated jaggery (or brown sugar)
450ml water
½ tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp cumin seeds, crushed
½ tsp dry ginger powder
½ tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp black salt, or rock salt
Spiced Chickpeas
1 tsp veg oil
1x400g can of chickpeas (and, or 3 medium potatoes)
1 small onion, finely diced
2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves
1 tsp roasted cumin powder
1 tsp chaat masala powder
¼ tsp red chilli powder (optional)
1 tsp black salt

Method
Puri
To make the puris, place the semolina, flour, a pinch of salt and pepper into a bowl, and gradually add the soda water.
Stir continuously until the mixture comes together and forms a soft dough. Place into a bowl that has been dusted with flour and cover with a damp tea towel for about 30 minutes. 
Place a large, deep pan or a wok on a gentle heat and pour in the vegetable oil and allow it to get really hot.
Separate the dough into 4 bits and roll it out so it's about 1.5cm thick. Using a 5cm cutter cut out as many circles as you can. Or take small grape sized balls of the puri dough and roll into a ball with your hands. On a floured surface roll it out to make thin, flat circles, about 5-6cm across.  
To test if it's hot enough, drop a tiny piece of dough into the pan – if it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, it's ready.
Very gently slide in one circle of puri dough and fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Then using your spoon to push them under the oil, then carefully flip them over and continue cooking for 1-2 minutes, until it's golden and crisp. Transfer to a kitchen paper to drain, and repeat with the remaining dough.
Green Pani
Place all the green pani ingredients, into a liquidiser. Make sure the jaggery has dissolved a little then and blitz until smooth.
Line a sieve with muslin, place over a large bowl and sieve the mixture to get an intense, flavoured water.
Sweet Date and Tamarind Chutney
In a pan, take the seedless tamarind, seedless dates and water. Cook for about 10 mins on a gentle heat.
Add the jaggery and stir. Once it has dissolved the mixture will thicken a little.
Stir in all the spices and salt then leave to simmer for a few more minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.
Pour the chutney mixture into a blender and grind until the chutney is smooth. Add a little water if required then strain the chutney through a sieve. This can be store in a jar and keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
Spiced Chickpeas
Boil the potatoes till they are cooked through. Peel and then chop them into small pieces.
Place 1 tbsp of oil into a pan and add the chickpeas sprinkle in cumin, chilli powder, salt and heat through. Using your spoon mash them a little and set to one side.
Finely chop the onion.
In a small bowl, mix the chickpeas (and potatoes if using), onions, coriander leaves. Mix well and keep aside.
To Serve
Make a hole in the top of the puri with your finger.
Fill with a little spiced chickpea mixture, add a dollop of the date and tamarind chutney, fill with the green water and put the whole thing in your mouth and let you taste buds dance.

CHICKEN 65
INGREDIENTS
There are many theories about how this dish gets its great name, one of which suggests it was invented in 1965, another that it originally contained 65 types of chilli. Either way, it’s a deliciously fiery Indian snack that’s great with a cold beer.
Note: you will need to begin this recipe several hours before you want to eat, or ideally the day before, as the chicken needs time to marinate.
 
SERVES 4 AS A SNACK
Ingredients
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon coriander seeds
500g skinless chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite-sized pieces
4 tablespoons natural yogurt
3 teaspoons rice flour
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
3cm piece fresh root ginger, grated
3 garlic cloves, crushed
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon chilli flakes, or to taste
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
a handful of curry leaves
2 red chillies, thinly sliced
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ red onion, thinly sliced, to serve
chopped coriander, to serve
lemon wedges (optional), to serve

METHOD

Set a small pan over a medium heat and add the cumin and coriander seeds. Toast for a minute or two until you can smell their aroma wafting up from the pan, then tip into a spice mill or pestle and mortar and grind to a powder. Transfer into a large bowl.
Add the chicken to the bowl, along with the yogurt, rice flour, vinegar, ginger, garlic, paprika, chilli flakes, turmeric and a little black pepper, stirring well to mix. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, or ideally overnight if you have time.
When you are ready to cook, preheat the oil in a deep fat fryer to 180°C/350°F. Add about 6–8 chicken pieces and fry for 4 minutes until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and repeat until you have cooked all the chicken.
Add the oil to a wok or large frying pan and set over a high heat. When it’s hot, tip in the cooked chicken, the curry leaves and red chilli, season with salt and pepper and stir fry for 2–3 minutes until the curry leaves have wilted and everything is hot and crisp.
Tip into a serving dish, scatter with the red onion and coriander and serve immediately with lemon wedges to squeeze over.

Move one step at a time: It is easy to get caught in the complexities of day trading, especially if you’re a beginner. That’s why we always advise beginners to move one small step at a time. It would help if you focused on a small number of stocks when you start since tracking positions is more comfortable that way. It is also a great way to master the technicalities before you make more significant trading decisions.
Study before trading first: Too many beginners make the mistake of jumping right in at the start of the day when they should first study the market moves for a good 15 minutes. Yes, the periods of volatility are also where the higher profits lie. Day trading is ideal in the 2 hours past the market opening and within the last hour of each trading day. There’s no denying the fact that rush hours are laden with the profits but they might not the best places to start for beginners right away!
Research everything: You cannot merely trade without understanding market trends first. It is best to follow the news and factors that can affect market and individual stock movements. Think about the stocks you’d like to trade and do your research thoroughly. Finance blogs, magazines, and news channels are great places to continuously track for the latest updates and opportunities that might be hiding in plain sight, so be on the lookout!
Be consistent: It is also a great idea to be consistent in your trading timings, which means you should trade at more or less the same time every day. Day traders can trade for either the whole session duration or for a specific part of the day.
Patterns are everything: When it comes to day trading lookout for repeating patterns that have yielded profit before and can be reapplied. It’s all about developing your own strategy or formula that works for you and sticking to it. Do not always fall for the temptation of making as much profit as possible; believe in your strategy and give it time.
Take notes: The importance of keeping your trading records is imperative. Write down your strategies, including what worked and what did not. It is of the essence to measure and analyze your performance if you are to succeed in the long-term, and you will be surprised at the rich insights your journal will provide you when you need them the most.

The 20 Tunnel
We can apply 2 20-period moving averages (high and low) to our charts to create a tunnel.
The allows us to ride  the trade sfor a long period of time
Pro: Create a more objective trade management approach

As long as the price is outside the tunnel, the trade is valid

Two exit options:
1:	Conservative[ When price enters the tunnel
2:	Aggresive: When the price crosses the tunnel completely

How the price trades into levels
1	Look for a trend
2	Wait until the trend slows down
3	Find a local support/resistance with at least 2 confirmation points
4	Wait for the trigger of the breakout
5	A new trend will emerge
